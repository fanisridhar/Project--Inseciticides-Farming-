"Cadmium (Cd) is a mobile, toxic, and non-biodegradable found in various waste streams that could be found in Black Soldier Fly (BSF) substrate. Heavy metals, especially Cadmium (Cd), can accumulate in black soldier fly larvae because of uptake from a contaminated waste. These metals are added to livestock feed to prevent diseases and promote growth in some countries, which is excreted with animal feces. The contaminated feces are then used as fertilizer for crops. This presents a potential risk to animal and crops, which may be fed black soldier fly products.","5"

This presents a potential risk to animal and crops, which may be fed black soldier fly products. Metallothionein (MT) proteins are involved in metal detoxification. For example, greater MT mRNA expression was associated with greater tolerance to Cd in other insects (springtail, Orchesella cincta). These pathways may be a route to reduce downstream risk for consumers of black soldier fly products.","4"
"Insects like the black soldier fly (BSF) have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria. Due to selective pressures like medicine and agriculture, though, some bacteria have developed antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. These AR genes can be directly shared with other bacteria, a process called vertical transmission. If BSF feed on waste containing AR genes, it is possible that larvae and frass will contain them too","4"

"An insect reared on recycled material is expected to encounter a wide variety of food. Many species exhibit preferences and special adaptations to some sources, which varies even between strains or breeding lines. An insect’s preference for a certain food or nutritional profile is rooted in its genetics. An organism that does not synthesize lysine (amino acid), for example, must find it in their diet. The black soldier fly (BSF) has achieved a lot of success as a commercial insect because it is a generalist, eating many kinds of food, but it still has its preferences. For example, in previous research, BSF larvae regularly chose to feed on pig manure over vegetable waste. If BSF are going to be waste recyclers, it is important that we understand how they make feeding choices. If we can identify genes related to those choices, it may be possible to create a line that is optimized for whatever food source is available and not the other way around.","2"

"As reported in the Jan 2023 P1 meeting, research suggests that the protein-carbohydrate ratio of an insect’s food source is important for health. The best ratio for black soldier fly is probably very carbohydrate heavy. This is useful for some vegetable waste streams, which are naturally low in protein. Other waste streams exceed the comfortable range of protein content, such as spent brewers yeast (65%), soy bran (35%), meat by-products (20% wet). One solution is to make our commercial insects more adapted to high-protein diets through artificial selection. This would allow a production facility to expand their food source options, by having multiple specialized commercial strains. On the other hand, it could also allow a facility to specialize in one kind of waste product, should they find an unexploited or cheap source.","2"

"May want to investigate the roll which yeast (easily culturable) volatiles can play in modulating insect population behavior. Could be a good way to increase pollinating behavior in some insects.","1"
"One way of managing the nutrient profile of black soldier fly (fat, protein, micronutrient content) is by changing the rearing diet. In some cases, though, optimal substrate may either be unavailable, because they are feeding on waste, or less economical to source. Another approach is to directly affect how insects produce, store, and metabolize industrially useful nutrients. Drosophila (fruit fly) females tend to store more fat than males. This paper argues that the sex-determination gene transformer is the reason. It may be possible to manipulate the activity of this pathway to create insects with different fat contents, all without changing their food source.","1"
"Speciation describes the process by which new species emerge. A single species develops reproductively isolated subpopulations, genetic differences build up between the two populations, and they eventually break off into separate species. Researchers don’t fully understand this process. Are there a few special places in a genome that make two different strains incompatible (islands of speciation model)? Maybe a lot of small, random changes build up over time instead. This is an important question to answer, given that commercial insects are often separated from their wild counterparts and exposed to strong artificial selection. At some point, domesticated insects will no longer be able to cross with the wild. Individual productions strains may similarly have trouble breeding with each other. This paper identifies a region of the X chromosome that might be responsible for incompatibility between two closely related cricket species. This is information that could be used to measure strain compatibility or warn of gene regions (and the traits they affect) that won’t mix during outbreeding.","1"
"Previous research on black soldier fly population genetics has shown that most commercial strains are highly similar too each other and possess a low level of diversity. The same study showed evidence of low-diversity escaped BSF at least 6 miles from production facilities. It is unclear what negative affects commercial strains will have on the surrounding ecosystem, but many invasive species start with human introduction. Will escaped domesticated BSF hybridize with wild populations and cause problems for humans and local wildlife? Will the constant flow of low-diversity genetic stock from rearing facilities reduce fitness for wild BSF? The answer is unclear and could be one barrier (from a regulatory point of view) to the introduction of commercial insects in some regions. This paper shows one example of a commercial species (domesticated chicken) negatively impacting their wild counterparts.","1"

"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been known since the early 1980s and the Cecropin class of AMPs were among the first to be isolated. Bioinformatic approaches have had success in mining insect genomes, producing real and synthetic AMPs, and testing them against pathogens, but functional validation of these genes used to be hampered by technological limitations. The authors use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to build mutant Drosophila (fruit fly) lines without working Cecropin genes and observe their function in pathogen defense. These proteins seem to be effective against fungi and a few gram-negative bacteria, possibly as an early response to infection. The black soldier fly has 34 Cecropins in the genomic resource database (GRD), 33 of which are on the (putative) domestication-associated Chromosome 5. These are goods target for follow up analyses, either internally through project 2 functional validations or outside the center.","1"

"Full fat larvae have been shown in other studies to be less digestible due to the fat, however this study showed that defatted BSFL were suitable up to 40%. More research can look into even higher substitiutions of defatted larvae, along with testing other insects as a replacement.","1"
"This study has significance for insect rearers as it provides new insights into the establishment of Leishmania donovani infections, which are transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies. The study shows that gut microbes from the sand fly, which are egested into the host skin alongside the parasites, play an important role in the establishment of these infections. The study suggests that reducing midgut microbiota by pretreatment of infected sand flies with antibiotics or neutralizing the effect of interleukin-1b in bitten mice could abrogate neutrophil recruitment and impair parasite visceralization. Understanding the role of gut microbes in vector-borne diseases could inform the development of new strategies to control insect-borne diseases.","1"

"Though larval crowding can increase development rates, it can have negative effects on health in mass rearing. ","1"
"nsect behavior is guided by odor cues. It affects everything from mating to diet preference. Olfaction (smelling) involves many receptors, transport proteins, and associated neurons, which means that the metabolic cost of odor sensitivity can be high. Like with most expensive traits, they tend to build up mutations when selection stops favoring them so strongly. The controlled environment of mass rearing has a less complex odor profile, and food/mates are often a few centimeters away, so domestication is likely to result in insects with much different (probably less sensitive) odor detection systems. Studying domestication related olfactory changes can be useful for building fundamental knowledge. Perhaps we can engineer a line of insects that become ravenous when they smell a particular kind of waste. Or maybe an insect can be engineered to mate only when a particular odor enters its containers, allowing for precise life cycle control. This paper describes the UGT36E1 gene and how it affects the ability of a fly to smell the difference between a male and a female. Manipulation of this gene, and genes like it, could be a step towards using odor cues to separate out males and females in colony.","1"

"For insect producers, this study offers valuable insights into the interactions between disease-causing parasites and the microbiota within insect vectors. Understanding how pathogens influence the insect's microbiome can have implications for disease transmission and vector control strategies. The findings also underscore the importance of considering the microbiome in insect health and vector competence. Such knowledge can aid producers in developing more targeted and effective approaches to managing vector-borne diseases and controlling insect populations.","1"
"Insect behavior is complex. Environmental stimuli can result in the coordination of many organs and the differential activation of thousands of genes. For example, the reflection of light against a wing can induce chasing, foreleg tapping, and mounting. The same is true for many other biological responses. Low blood sugar encourages humans to seek out food, results in increased irritability, and promotes the breakdown of body fat and glycogen reserves. Ultimately, though, many of these pathways are beholden to one or a few master regulators (I.e insulin in human sugar response). This paper discusses the Tyrosine hydroxylase gene, which affects dopamine levels. Domesticated silkworms have been selected for decreased foraging and climbing behavior and research has shown that these individuals have significantly lower dopamine than their wild counterparts. This is probably due to changes in a gene (Met1) that regulates Tyrosine hydroxylase. Rather than wait 6000 years for crickets to adapt, like the ancient silkworm industry, it may be possible to directly manipulate dopamine signaling to reduce escape behavior and aggression.","1"
"Artificial selection is a powerful tool to alter an organism, but it comes with some challenges. Some traits are easy to measure, like body size or growth time, but even these “simple” traits are built upon many interacting proteins. To complicate the problem, many genes are passed on through mixing chunks of DNA (recombination). If one selects strongly for a gene involved in egg laying, they might also get a hitchhiking gene variant with reduced disease tolerance, simply because the two genes are close together on the DNA strand. This is why insect breeding must be done with more care than picking out the fastest growing larvae. This paper shows both how artificial selection can be used to increase fertility and also some pitfalls to avoid when designing a selection program.","1"

"Silkworms were first domesticated thousands of years ago, before the founding of Rome and the Great Wall of China. Modern insect agriculturists have much to gain from observation of well tested sericulture practices (silkworm breeding). Modern silk production offers interesting insights too. Genetically modified silkworms have produced multicolored or glowing silk. They are being explored for mass production of collagen, amino acids, and bioactive compounds. The authors of this paper describe a commercial species called the Chinese oak silkworm. It is resistant to the coumaphos pesticide that is sprayed to suppress silkworm parasites, but the exact mechanism behind this tolerance was unclear. Pesticide resistance is important to pre-consumer waste recycling insects, like the “big three” black soldier fly, mealworm, and crickets, which might be exposed to any number of treatments. Flies (black soldier fly), beetles (mealworm), and crickets all contain pest species, which creates incentive to study these pathways. It is possible that pesticide resistance research, if the relevant genes are defined, will translate to greater fitness and waste source options in the big three recyclers.","1"

"Chitin is a major component of the insect cuticle, which is responsible for how tough and flexible their exoskeleton is. The cuticle also protects the insect from desiccation (drying out) and disease. Genes involved in chitin synthesis are critical for development, but they aren’t well understood in the mealworm (Tenebrio molitor). Researching how chitin production is regulated and expressed is a key part of maintaining the health of future stock. This paper details the kinds of genes that are expressed in the developing mealworm, and when they are active. The transcriptomic information provided by this paper can be exploited in future genetics studies, since mealworms respond to RNA interference (RNAi) techniques. It is possible to temporarily silence gene expression, using RNAi, and see how it alters development, which will guide breeding programs. This information is also transferable to other insects. Perhaps by targeting one of the chitin genes related to wing development, one can create flightless BSF.","1"
"Most of the costs associated with the genomic resource database project, after grad student tuition and pay, were from sequencing. This is because the best bioinformatic analysis tools happen to be free and open source. Data acquisition can be expensive, though. For example, the collection of native BSF was a project to itself that require international travel and several weeks of field work. Then, DNA must be extracted, processed, and sequenced. Human genome wide association studies have anywhere between several thousand and several hundred thousand samples and the 1000 Genomes project conservatively cost more than 30 million USD. The insect agriculture sector is unlikely to match this scale for any single species or study. It is important to determine the smallest number of samples needed to get reliable results. Fortunately, based on this paper, measurements of genetic differentiation can found with 4-6 samples under the right conditions.","1"

"The silkworm has been successfully domesticated for thousands of years. It represents a good model for understanding how commercial rearing affects insects on a behavioral and genetic level. Some traits are highly useful in the wild, like predator defense mechanisms, but aren’t worth the cost in controlled environments. The domesticated silkworm, for example, doesn’t need to mimic branches to hide from predators. Humans rear them indoors and watch out for pests in the facilities. The problem is that domestication can also lead to loss of other useful traits, like cold tolerance or pathogen resistance. Understanding which genes are under selection by domestication will help IAB members maintain the fitness and health of their insects, without spending a lot of resources on environmental controls like heating or cooling.","1"
"May want to consider that fish fed the insect meal diet showed a lower microbial diversity in the digesta but increased diversity in the mucosa. The microbiome of the fish on the insect diet were similar to the microbial profile of the feeds but not the water. This could be a way to not only modulate the intestinal microbiome but to also temper the effects of pathogens historically spread in the water in aquaculture farms.","1"
"Reporter genes are an important part of developing genetic modification protocols. Visually obvious traits like color change are markers that show you’ve integrated the gene into your target organism. You can see when and where a gene is being expressed without grinding them up for RNA extraction. The authors of this paper knock out the Hiwhite gene to confirm that, like the white Drosophila homolog, this gene is important for eye color. They demonstrate how one can go about successfully using CRISPR/Cas to introduce foreign DNA into the black soldier fly. This information will help guide future GMO study designs, which are already in progress for the genomic resource database (GRD) at the time of writing.","1"
"This review is highly relevant to insect producers engaged in disease management and biocontrol strategies, specifically concerning Aedes mosquitoes and arboviral diseases. It emphasizes the pivotal role of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus as primary disease vectors and the global health threats posed by diseases like dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Understanding the microbiota-virome interplay within these mosquitoes holds promise for devising effective control measures against emerging arboviruses. The insights into the impact of resident microorganisms on vectorial competence and their ability to modify arboviral life cycles offer valuable avenues for insect producers to explore targeted biocontrol strategies aimed at managing disease transmission by these vectors. The review underscores the significance of comprehending the microbiota-virome dynamics in Aedes mosquitoes, presenting potential implications for insect producers involved in biocontrol and disease prevention efforts against arboviral diseases.","1"
"All 4 insects can be reared on food by-products, however the roaches and BSF were able to use them all more efficiently compared to the mealworms and crickets. More research needs to go into proper combinations of these by-products to optimize rearing.","1"

"The relevance of this study for insect growers is that it provides insights into the potential for precision breeding and feeding schemes to optimize the production of black soldier flies (BSF), which can be used to convert organic waste into valuable insect protein as an alternative animal feed ingredient. The study shows that matching BSF genetics to dietary contexts is vital for purposive production optimization, particularly when extrapolated to large-scale operations. Therefore, establishing tailored BSF breeding as an independent branch offers veritable opportunities to efficiently support this growing agricultural sector.","1"
"Silkworms have been selectively bred for many centuries. Many problems currently faced in commercial insect rearing were encountered before the founding of Rome, the Great Wall of China, and the construction of ancient Egyptian pyramids. Silkworms are a good resource for tried-and-true practices, based on this history, but the modern techniques explored in the silkworm industry are also highly transferrable to food/feed insects. Genetic modification through transposons (mobile gene elements) is one such technique. The authors of this paper use genetic modification to artificially increase the disease resistance of their strain, by increasing the expression of cecropin B (an antimicrobial peptide).","1"

"Kissing bugs are known as vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas’ disease. Despite their high epidemiological relevance, their biology and bacterial symbiosis remain poorly understood. This study investigated the host-microbiome relationship of five Triatoma species and applied 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding to obtain a more comprehensive view of triatomine microbiomes. The study found that triatomine gut microbiome composition is strongly influenced by ontogeny, species identity, and the environment. The microbiomes are characterised by a significant loss in bacterial diversity throughout ontogenetic development. The bacterial genus Dietzia dominates late-stage nymphs and adults of some Triatoma species. Species-specific microbiome composition, particularly pronounced in early instars, is further modulated by locality-specific effects. The study is the first to demonstrate deterministic patterns in microbiome composition among all life stages and multiple Triatoma species, highlighting the complexity of Triatominae symbiosis with bacteria.","1"
"Understanding the complex interactions between fungi and insects can have practical applications for insect growers.

"This review explores the holobiont concept in the context of mosquito-associated microbial communities and their significance in vector biology and pathogen transmission. While the holobiont concept initially emerged in coral ecosystems, its extension to various organisms, including insects, particularly haematophagous vectors like mosquitoes, remains relatively unexplored. Mosquitoes pose a significant global health threat due to the rise in mosquito-borne diseases, prompting increased research on both the mosquito host and its associated microbiota. Although many studies in this area have been descriptive, they have provided valuable insights into the diverse bacterial communities hosted by mosquito populations. The review highlights recent advancements in understanding mosquito microbiota, including the functional roles of microbiota and their interactions with host biology and disease transmission. By considering the ecology of multipartite interactions, the review suggests that defining mosquitoes and their microbiota as a holobiont could offer a comprehensive understanding of the vector pathosystem, aiding in the development of novel and effective vector control strategies.","1"

"This study focuses on the microbiomes within colonies of Trachymyrmex septentrionalis fungus-growing ants across various geographic regions and castes. The research uncovered that worker ants maintain a consistent microbiome across colonies, with more similarity within colonies than between them. A more extensive analysis involving all available castes in two colonies, before and after adapting to laboratory conditions, revealed that microbiomes differed significantly between colonies, castes, and rearing conditions. Notably, Tenericute bacterial symbionts showed substantial variation in abundance across these ant microbiomes. The findings highlight that individual colonies significantly influence microbiome composition, while differences in castes and environmental conditions further shape these microbiomes. This study offers insights into microbiome assembly within social insects like T. septentrionalis, emphasizing the impact of colony, caste, and lab adaptation on microbiome diversity and function. It cautions against limited sampling in comprehending the diversity and functionality of microbiomes, especially in social insect colonies, underscoring the unique nature of individuality in their microbiomes.","1"
"For insect growers, this study carries important implications as it challenges conventional assumptions about the beneficial role of the bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum. The surprising discovery that L. plantarum can shorten the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster by affecting stem cell activity in the gut highlights the complexity of host-microbe interactions. These findings underscore the necessity for a nuanced understanding of the effects of gut microbes on insect health, which can be influenced by factors like age, genetics, bacterial strains, and diet. The study also reinforces the value of Drosophila as a model system for investigating the intricate dynamics of probiotics, providing insights that could guide more targeted and effective strategies for insect health and pest management.","1"
"There were minor effects on growth performance at the highest inclusion rate of BSFL, but these were full-fat larvae. Results could very much differ with defatted larvae.

"The genetic landscape of the Black Soldier Fly (BSF) is poorly described in literature. Even with the recent boom of scientific interest; most studies concern feed trials, microbial interactions, and nutritional/chemical profiles. This paper shows the wide level of diversity present in BSF across the planet. IAB can leverage variation between known lab/industrial strains and (as of now) uncharacterized wild populations to introduce new functions (like improved resistance to a particular environmental stress) into their BSF lines.","1"
"The tomato was already pretty well domesticated by the time it was introduced to Europe in the 1500s. Modern farming imposed further strong selection on useful traits like seed size, shape, and disease resistance. The downside to this method is that you are limiting genetic diversity (and available traits) to the handful of phenotypes that are observable. As in tomato cultivation, inbreeding and selection among mass-reared insects such as BSF can narrow genetic diversity, posing challenges for their improvement. The creation of a pan-genome, which captures a wide spectrum of genetic variants from diverse wild populations, can aid in the identification of essential genes for targeted breeding or genetic modification projects. Such an approach can help reveal genes related to crucial traits like disease resistance, potentially enhancing the resilience and productivity of commercial BSF strains. This paper demonstrates how pangenomic studies, which have been cheaper in recent years, can identify lost traits like flavor and resistance to certain pathogens.","1"
"BSF larvae have been shown to accumulate some heavy metals, however more research needs to be done into how this increase of metals will affect livestock if used as a feed ingredient.","1"
"The wild cabbage is a famous example of the drastic changes that domestication can exert on an orgasm. Kale, Broccoli, Collard greens, cabbages, and Brussel sprouts are among the many cultivars that remain a single species with morphological differences brought upon by artificial selection. Insect agriculture species perform well but, like the wild cabbage, they have potential for improvement and specialization. These adaptations can develop without deliberate selection. For example, in isolated BSF exclusively reared on banana peels or those regularly exposed to ambient temperatures exceeding 40 Celsius. Many of these changes are brought on by structural variations (SVs), where sections of a chromosome are duplicated, lost, or inverted. This paper is a large scale pangenomic study that tracks SVs across different cabbage cultivars, showing how they were critical in developing the traits that made each plant strain commercially successful. A similar undertaking with insect agriculture species would incur high sequences costs, but it would reveal much about the nature of domestication and how it can be leveraged to improve stock.","1"

"This paper provides a framework for studies investigating the role of different rhodopsins in BSF or other farmed insects. This type of research could prove particularly relevant to BSF considering how vital of a role light plays in their mating system.

"Many discussions on the topic of black soldier fly nutrition come from the perspective of identifying an optimal substrate profile in order to maximize performance. In many cases, such as BSF reared on waste streams, an idealized diet may not be achievable. Another route is to adapt the organism to an economically viable food source, either through breeding or direct genetic modification. The insulin-like receptor pathway is associated with growth and response to nutrition. This paper shows how specific insulin like peptides affect Drosophila melanogaster’s (fruit fly) appetite based on the kind of carbohydrate it is fed. Modification of genes in this pathway may make a particular food source more appealing to BSF.","1"

"Domestication leads to changes, deliberate and accidental, to an organism’s genome. The sampling of a small number of organisms for mass rearing creates population bottlenecks that reduce population diversity. Humans often impose environmental conditions that are drastically different from the wild, which further limits available genetic material as selection favors a narrow set of traits. The silkworm is arguably the only fully domesticated insect species, so the industry is a good resource to understand what domestication might look like for newly added species. Domestication related behavioral changes are common across the animal kingdom. For example, commercial silkworms have an absent or suppressed climbing instinct, which makes them easier to handle in mass rearing. The authors of this paper investigate Met1, which may be acted on by human selection to drive behavior changes.","1"

"There is a lot of variation between commercial lines of mealworms in terms of traits like growth performance, development time, and food conversion efficiency. The insect industry, in general, is lacking information about genotype-phenotype relationships. The mealworm is no exception. Unlike BSF, it lacks a high-quality public genome. It is also evolutionarily separated from the model organism Drosophila (fruit fly), which is a useful starting point for functional genetics, by hundreds of millions of years. If we can’t learn about mealworm genes by comparing them to other species, one way to start is parent-offspring regression. It is a process that calculates how closely related a parent is with a child, which helps scientists determine how much genetics is involved in a trait.

"This paper is highly relevant to insect growers as it explores the use of microbial supplements to optimize the growth and production of black soldier fly larvae. Black soldier fly larvae are widely used in the insect farming industry as a source of protein and fat for animal feed, and their ability to efficiently convert organic waste into biomass makes them a promising solution for sustainable waste management. The study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits and limitations of using specific types of microbes as supplements in the diets of black soldier fly larvae, and highlights the importance of evaluating targeted microbes prior to implementation. The findings can help insect growers to make informed decisions about the use of microbial supplements to optimize larval growth and waste conversion, and to develop more effective and sustainable insect rearing practices. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that benchtop and industrial scale results can differ, emphasizing the need for insect growers to conduct trials at scale relevant to their operation. By adopting the approaches and insights provided in this paper, insect growers can potentially improve the efficiency and profitability of their operations while contributing to a more sustainable food system.","1"

"When wild species become domesticated, they experience changes in genes and gene expression. Some of these changes are deliberate, commercially desired traits. Others are unintended consequences of population bottle necks (starting with small number of individuals), relaxation of selective pressures (for example, more sterile rearing environment), or the hitchhiking of linked genes. Also, if a gene product is costly to produce, and the environment is no longer strongly maintaining its frequency, it could be lost in the population. For example, antimicrobial peptides are effective against pathogens but are energetically expensive. Many species that transition to a more sterile food source (like aphids) simply lose functional AMP genes, through the accumulation of unchecked mutations. It is important to understand how artificial selection affected the maintenance of these important traits in commercial insects. In addition, as it relates to BSF, an understanding of the genetic/evolutionary mechanisms that drive oviposition preference will help with the design of egg traps and egg production systems. This paper shows that oviposition preference, guided by odor cues, is not likely to be changed in BSF, given that several thousand years of domestication was not enough to change the silkworm.","1"

"The diversity of life on Earth, ranging from 116-meter redwood trees to the thumb sized bumblebee bats, shows that natural selection is a powerful force. Studying the effect of natural selection on traits can be challenging. Many traits involve multiple genes and change very slowly. For example, there are about 4-7 million years separating humans from chimpanzees, our closest living relatives. Fortunately, human selection on other species is often much stronger. In insects, which produce many young and have short lifespans, breeding programs have shown significant increases in growth within a few months. The German cockroach studies in this paper is a pest, but related species are already commercially reared for feed. The authors reviewed how human pressures can affect insect feeding preference. For them, this was about understanding how cockroaches evolve genetic changes that help them avoid smells from poisoned traps. For IAB, it is important to consider how artificial selection can strengthen a commercial insect’s preference for a particular kind of food, which can lead to greater productivity.","1"

"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small, stable, and heat-resistant proteins with bactericidal properties (kills bacteria). They also have a potent inhibitory effect on fungi, viruses, and tumor cells. AMPs often work by disrupting cell membranes but have also been known to inhibit cell wall formation, inhibit cell respiration, or even induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) by attacking bacterial proteins. An AMP’s durability and effectiveness against microbes is directly determined by its 3D structure, so researchers must study form if they wish to optimize function. Members of the IAB benefit from doing the same, in order to ensure the safety of their product reared in variable, and potentially contaminated, waste streams.","1"

"Insect behavior is complex. Environmental stimuli can result in the coordination of many organs and the differential activation of thousands of genes. For example, the reflection of light against a wing can induce chasing, foreleg tapping, and mounting. The same is true for many other biological responses. Low blood sugar encourages humans to seek out food, results in increased irritability, and promotes the breakdown of body fat and glycogen reserves. Ultimately, though, many of these pathways are beholden to one or a few master regulators (I.e., insulin in human sugar response). This paper discusses the effects of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) on black widow spiders. Though black widows aren’t insects, there is precedence for those two hormones modulating aggression in insect species like flies, crickets, and ants. There is also precedence for the manipulation of these hormones in insect farming. Domesticated silkworms have been selected for decreased foraging and climbing behavior since at least 3000 BCE. Research has shown that these individuals have significantly lower dopamine than their wild counterparts. This is probably due to changes in a gene (Met1) that regulates Tyrosine hydroxylase, which in turn affects dopamine. Rather than wait 6000 years for crickets to adapt, like the ancient silkworm industry, it may be possible to directly manipulate dopamine signaling to reduce escape behavior and aggression.","1"
"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been at the forefront of advancements in genetics research since the early 1900s. As a consequence, there is a lot of data publicly available as far as functional genetics. Much of the ongoing work in CEIF’s genetic data library starts from Flybase, where the function of fruit fly genes are well mapped, and that data is compared to other commercial insects. Of the big three, Black soldier flies are most closely related to the fruit fly with a divergence time (in very broad terms) of 200 million years. Beetles are closer to 240 million years and crickets are 300. To put things into perspective, humans and mice are only maybe 80 million years apart. For these reasons, it can be hard to directly compare the function of homologs (related genes between species). This paper shows that beetles, which mealworms are a part of, have a very different set of developmental genes. It emphasizes the importance of expanding our limited set of model organisms.","1"

"Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is one of the most common ways researchers measure gene expression, which tells them how an organism responds to their environment. Good reference genes for qPCR are genes that are produced at the same levels at different times and conditions. A good reference gene in mealworm, may not be as stabile in the black soldier fly, for example, so they must be experimentally determined in each species. Once identified, though, qPCR can offer clues about specific genes or pathways that are turned on in response to changes in their environment, like different feeding substrates or temperature extremes. This information can reveal targets for breeding programs or genetic modification.","1"

"Many insect behaviors, like feeding preference and oviposition (laying eggs) are guided by odors. Chemicals called VOCs (volatile organic compounds) are released from decaying organic material and they are detected by chemoreception proteins. In order to understand complex behaviors, like feed choice or reproduction, it is important to understand how chemoreceptor proteins work. An important first step is studying the genes that make chemoreceptors and identifying which VOCs are produced by a given substrate. We can exploit knowledge of which compounds attract or repulse commercial insects, and how these signals are generated, to drive their behavior towards productive activities. For example, by increasing their interest in a particular waste stream or optimizing oviposition timing and placement.","1"

"The concept of compartmentalization is highly relevant to insect growers who often rely on symbiotic relationships with microorganisms to improve insect performance and production. Understanding how hosts control and mediate interactions with symbionts can help insect growers develop strategies to enhance the benefits obtained from symbiotic partners. The article's discussion of compartmentalization in insects and nutrient provisioning bacteria, such as those involved in termite gut symbiosis, is particularly relevant to insect growers as these relationships are essential for insect nutrition and growth. The article highlights that compartmentalization allows hosts to reward cooperative symbionts and control non-cooperative ones, which can aid insect growers in optimizing the microbial communities associated with insect rearing. Additionally, understanding the factors that influence the evolution of compartmentalization can help insect growers predict the likelihood of this mechanism evolving in new symbiotic relationships and plan accordingly.","1"
"Repeating elements in DNA, also known as repetitive elements, are sequences repeated many times in the genome. Originally, much of this repetitive DNA was labeled as junk DNA, which reflected the belief that these sequences were evolutionary leftovers that had no active role in the biology of an organism. Now scientists understand that repeating elements have many roles such as the regulation of gene expression, the rate of evolution, and maintaining the structure and integrity of chromosomes. Consider the mealworm, which contains a single repeating structure that accounts for about half of its total genome length. The black soldier fly is currently reported to have as much as 67% repeating elements, literally off the charts in some studies. These sequences' repetitive nature makes them particularly challenging to capture, and public data is increasingly scarce the more distance a species is from model organisms. So, it is up to researchers in insect agriculture to generate this information themselves.","1"

The research underscores the significant influence of dietary phytochemicals from peppers on the gut microbiome, affecting microbial composition and abundance, particularly of Lactobacillaceae and Acetobacteraceae. Understanding how specific compounds within peppers, such as β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, myricetin, quercetin, and apigenin, correlate with microbial enhancement offers potential implications for manipulating microbiomes in beneficial ways for insect health and biocontrol. This study's emphasis on the interplay between dietary factors, microbial communities, and genetic backgrounds in shaping the gut microbiome presents valuable implications for insect producers aiming to optimize insect health and biocontrol strategies through dietary interventions and microbial modulation.","1"
"For a long time, biologists believed that evolution traits were mediated by genetics, which was a one-way flow from DNA (the manual) to RNA (the instructions) to proteins (the resulting product). This concept is called the central dogma. Recently, we have come to understand that organisms require a complex web of information exchange between each step. Proteins can be modified after they are made or bind to pieces of DNA to block a gene. Chemical groups can be added directly to DNA, or the histone proteins that organize DNA, to affect how much genes are expressed. Sometimes these changes can pass on to the next generation. Epigenetics describes changes that don’t alter the DNA sequence but are stable and can be inherited. This is a newly emerging field and the concept of population epigenetics, which expands research to include the epigenetics of large groups, is even more cutting edge. The authors of this paper synthesize the latest epigenetics studies to describe the epigenetic variation of wild populations. Understanding these interactions provides one more tool for insect breeders to control the health and productivity of their stock.","1"
"The authors of this paper are primarily concerned with killing flies but, in identifying genes response for defense against fungal pesticides, they are also identifying high fitness traits for breeders interested in protecting them. Pathogenic fungi work by burrowing holes in insect chitin and releasing toxins. They can be highly effective as biopesticides, but some mosquitos are resistant to infection. The authors identify several regions of interest, one containing three genes, APL1A, APL1C, and LRIM1, that may be responsible for resistance in these strains. Any of these could be targets for improvement in the black soldier fly.","1"

"Domestication is often associated with a weakened response to stressors like bacterial challenges. This problem is compounded by high rearing densities, which facilitates the spread of pathogens. Disease outbreaks can be extremely costly, both in terms of insect loss and potential dangers to human health. The authors of this paper discuss breeding strategies and gene editing systems to improve resistance to known silkworm pathogens. The pathogens associated with silkworm production are well established, given that sericulture is older than the founding of Rome. These strategies can be translated to other new commercial insects like the black soldier fly, which are less well described. At the time of writing, CEIF research is already underway to characterize the BSF microbiome and potential pathogenic hazards therein.

"Genetic modification has the potential to transform the way insects are reared. In traditional breeding, individuals that show the strongest version of a desired trait are selected for the next generation. Selection pressure does not create new mutations, it works on variants that already exist in a population. This variation is limited in many domesticated species, because of inbreeding and population bottlenecks. Though there are comparatively large starting costs, through discovery research and implementation, you can introduce genes directly from high performing strains outside the commercial line. Or other species, or genes not found in any species. For example, black soldier fly antimicrobial peptide (kills bacteria) genes were inserted into silkworms to improve their survival in a bacterial challenge. This paper describes a genetic modification system tailored to the black soldier fly, which will be useful for anyone looking for modern approaches to stock improvement.","1"
"The findings of this study have significant implications for the insect rearing industry. Insect rearing is a rapidly growing industry that has numerous applications, such as food and feed production, waste management, and research. The microbial community of insects can play a crucial role in their physiology, immunity, and overall health. Understanding the factors that shape the microbial community of insects, such as host species variation, can help improve the efficiency and quality of insect rearing. This study's findings suggest that the microbial community of insects is highly dependent on the host species, rather than their evolutionary history, and that different host species can have varying levels of control over their microbial community composition. Therefore, it is important for the insect rearing industry to consider the host species when selecting and managing their microbial community. Furthermore, the study found that some microbial taxa that are beneficial for one host species can be deleterious for another, highlighting the importance of maintaining specific microbial communities for each host species. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between host species and their microbial community and can aid in developing strategies to optimize insect rearing practices.","1"

"Mitochondria are organelles in a cell that produce energy-containing molecules and have their own set of DNA separate from the “main” nuclear genome. They are self-replicating and only pass on from the mother, which has implications for how they evolve in populations. Evidence suggests that the integrity of mitochondrial DNA is generally preserved through purifying selection, which is to say that the genes stored in the mitochondria are important enough that they aren’t easily changed or lost. This paper shows that the opposite may be true for domesticated or domesticating species, which describes all of the organisms in insect agriculture. It explores how domestication impacts the integrity of mitochondrial DNA – potentially affecting traits like metabolism rates, reproductive capabilities, and resilience to environmental changes – all of which are key to success in mass rearing.","1"

Despite differences in gut microbiomes, the results found no evidence for diet-associated RI or a role of gut bacteria, suggesting that the evolutionary importance of gut microbiomes in host divergence needs careful consideration on a case-by-case basis.","1"
"The first assembled human genome cost about 3 billion dollars (in the 90s) and 13 years of organized effort. Today, even relatively small companies and labs can support previously cost prohibitive projects like genome assembly. Nor are we limited to whole genome data. Gene expression, proteomics (all the protein), and epigenetic (not DNA, but still stable and heritable) analyses are available to more fully capture what separates one species or individual from another. Knowing where to start, which assays to choose, and how to set up an experiment that will deliver results is most of the battle. This is especially true with eukaryote (plant, animal, fungi) pangenomics, which combines multiple genomes together to more completely capture the diversity of a species. This paper reviews recent pangenomic studies and demonstrates how many more valuable genes can be captured if we cast a wider net.","1"

"A major component of population and functional genetics is comparing DNA sequence data with phenotypic (observable traits) data. For example, one line of insects might produce larger larvae than the rest. Identifying the genetics responsible allows for reproducibility and fine-tuning of this trait. One could insert or breed the large larvae genes into other populations, using markers identified by this research to guide the process. One might find that the large larvae gene comes with unacceptable tradeoffs, and research might uncover a downstream gene more specific to the phenotype and with less side effects. Manual collection of detailed, standardized phenotypes for a given sample continues to be important for the statistical analyses that identify candidate genes. Unfortunately, these experiments require trained labor and have the associated throughput limitations. This paper proposes a network based genomic selection program to find high-fitness genes, which is to say that the approach filters lots of sequencing information into statistical analyses to find which combination of genes lead to useful traits.","1"

"Though it presents some ethical concerns, flightless black soldier flies have been explored for better containment during mass rearing. In addition to better production efficiency, flightlessness reduces the chance that domesticated BSF will escape and hybridize with local populations. This important because one regulatory barrier to the introduction of domesticated and genetically modified BSF in a region is concerns about foreign DNA mixing. Silkworms, a major commercial insect in the moth family, developed the flightless trait through millennia of selection.

"Transposable elements (TE) are small pieces of DNA that move around in a genome. They have long been associated with genetic disorders and disease, as they can break genes if they are inserted in the middle of one (among other problems). The authors of this paper explain, though, there is increasing evidence for the benefits of TEs in adaptive evolution. Little information is available on the potential role of TEs in domestication. This paper makes a case for the role of TEs in several important commercial traits. For example, increased developmental uniformity in silkworms or adaptation to different light cycles in corn. The silkworm (Bombyx mori) is arguably the only completely domesticated insect, so it is a good model to look at when making inferences about the future of other insects still in the process of domestication, like mealworm, cricket, and black soldier fly.","1"

"Fatty acids are involved in growth, development and immune defense. Ongoing research is exploring the value of lauric acid supplementation in boiler chicken health, for example. While diet is a major factor in insect fat content, though, the production and storage of fat is also governed by genetic factors. Supplementation needs to be added in every batch, may involve costly or difficult to obtain materials, and creates one more variable to manage in the substrate. Though genetic modification can involve significant starting costs, from discovery research to implementation, the benefit of increased fatty acid synthesis is passed on many generations later. The risk/reward of either approach varies with each use case. If GMO is warranted, though, manipulation of Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a promising route. The authors of this paper show how ACP, involved in fatty acid synthesis, affects key biological proccesses like size, survival, and egg laying.","1"
"The use of antibiotics has applied a selection force on aquatic bacteria where those that, by random chance, have genes giving resistance survive and reproduce. Bacteria can also directly transfer antibiotic resistance (AR) genes through a process called vertical transmission. This means that a bacterial line doesn’t need to have experienced penicillin, they just need to meet a bacterium that has. Coupled with a short life span and generation time sometimes measured in minutes, it is easy to see why antibiotic resistance is such a large problem. Insects are known sources of potentially pathogenic microbes. Those microbes may be sources of AR genes too. The goal for Black Soldier flies is a closed loop system where organic material is recycled. It is especially important that scientists can track which, if any, contaminants like AR genes can circulate.","1"

"Epigenetics studies heritable (passed on to children) changes in gene expression without DNA sequence changes. DNA is wrapped in proteins so that it stays organized in cells, which can be tighter or looser to affect how much of a gene is expressed. Chemical groups can also be added to DNA directly to affect gene expression. This means, if one only looks at DNA sequences, they are likely to miss important information about the mechanism behind important traits. For example, in large studies across the animal kingdom, it was often found that domestication forces (which commercial insects experience) lead to stronger changes in gene expression than DNA. This paper reviews how epigenetic changes can lead to insecticide and climate change resistance, the latter of which is most useful for high-density insects that are prone to overheating.","1"

"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small pieces of RNA that don’t code for a protein. Instead, they influence the availability of protein coding RNAs, which adds another layer of regulation to protein production. Often, breeding for a particular trait will influence how much a protein is produced more than changes to amino acid sequence. To understand the full impacts of selection, it is important to track changes in non-coding RNAs in research. Also, because many key genes are highly networked, direct modifications could impose significant fitness costs, which shows the importance of more subtle miRNA-based trait manipulation. This paper describes development related miRNAs in the red flour beetle, which is in the same family as mealworms and superworms. The insights provided here lay the groundwork for future breeding or GMO experiments targeting optimal growth rates.","1"

"Domestication leads to changes, deliberate and accidental, to an organism’s genome. The sampling of a small number of organisms for mass rearing creates population bottlenecks that reduce population diversity. Humans often impose environmental conditions that are drastically different from the wild, which further limits available genetic material as selection favors a narrow set of traits. These changes are more complex than whole genome diversity losses, though. DNA goes through many steps to create a trait (DNA>RNA>Protein), each of which is regulated and can be acted on by domestication. It is important to understand how mass rearing affects insects at each level. This is true both for proactively managing potential risks to colony health and maximizing the benefits of domestication. In this paper, the authors show that gene expression diversity was lower in domesticated animals and plants like the silkworm, which is the oldest domesticated insect. Given that RNAseq (measures gene expresion) is cheaper than DNA sequencing, it may be a more feasible approach to colony monitoring. One could look at a few key markers rather than whole genome sequencing.","1"
"Heavy metals, especially Cadmium (Cd), can accumulate in black soldier fly larvae because of uptake from a contaminated waste. These metals are added to livestock feed to prevent diseases and promote growth in some countries, which are excreted with animal feces. Pre-consumer vegetable waste streams are more commonly discussed in black soldier fly (BSF) rearing substrates. Recycling manure is also viable, both for food production and waste management. Heavy metal contamination in pig feces is worse than other traditional livestock. Not only does this present a risk for crops and livestock that receive black soldier fly products, but a toxic substrate could have bad effects on the larvae themselves. This paper investigates how different larval densities affect the heavy metal concentration of frass.","1"

"Silkworms were first domesticated thousands of years ago, before the founding of Rome and the Great Wall of China. Modern insect agriculturists have much to gain from observation of well tested sericulture practices (silkworm breeding). Modern silk production offers interesting insights too. Genetically modified silkworms have produced multicolored or glowing silk. They are being explored for mass production of collagen, amino acids, and bioactive compounds such as human platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), which is associated with wound healing. One problem is that silkworms, for the most part, can only eat Mulberry leaves. Similar genetic modifications can be made to generalists like many CEIF species. It may be possible to transform low quality waste into highly valued biomolecules, all at large scales and using mostly unskilled labor (after the organisms have been designed).","1"
"Silkworms have been domesticated for many centuries. The silkworm industry, and its model organism, is useful for informing best practices in the management and analysis of modern commercial insects. Silkworms breeding programs have led to major increases in silk production, but, at the time of writing, very little was known about underlying mechanisms. The authors of this paper discuss improved silkworm lines through heterosis, which has been described in Chinese literature as far back as the 1600s. Heterosis, also known as hybrid vigor, describes the process by which some combinations of parents lead to offspring that are more fit than either parent. The authors use gene expression and proteomics (studying all proteins) to explain how crosses between different strains led to more silk yield. Briefly, the end goal is to take what is known about “good” combinations of genes and apply it to genetically modified products.","1"

"Many insect agriculture species have poorly defined genomes, given their novelty, so a lot of projects must begin with characterizing their genes, sometimes relying on reference genomes of the closest relative with a complete assembly. The basic way biologists identify genes in a new species has been the same for the last two decades. Sequence data is piped into hidden markhov models like Augustus (which at the time of writings is pretty much all the center uses) and takes hints from what we know about existing genes in other species. These HMMs don’t do well outside of the species it was designed for, which is a problem for insect agriculture. The closest related species on the web browser Augustus to the black soldier fly, for example, is the 200 million year distant fruit fly, which is why pipelines like BRAKER add pretraining steps.

"Not all traits involved in commercial insect production are heritable, which is the ability for a trait to be passed down genetically. While many traits in insects are determined by their genetics, there are also many traits that are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, rearing density, and feeding substrate. When a trait is affected by a combination of these factors, it can be difficult to determine which is most important to focus on. By studying the genetic basis of traits and their heritability, scientists can develop more accurate and effective breeding strategies.

"Good genetics is an important part of a successful organism, but DNA is only the beginning of the complex web of biological processes that are responsible for an organism's traits. The central dogma describes how DNA becomes RNA, RNA becomes protein, and proteins act together to create anything from intestines to neural tissue. Each step is regulated and informed by environmental conditions. Ideally, an insect will respond to new environmental conditions by changing the activity of these steps. For example, a company may wish to expand to a drier location and their insects have been adapted to high humidity. In some cases, the results could be disastrous, leading to delayed or absent oviposition. In others, the organism might upregulate a gene associated with water conservation and thrive in the new facility. We call the change of traits in response to a different environment, with the same genetics, “phenotypic plasticity”. The authors of this paper study phenotypic plasticity of the field cricket. They show that, in the short term, high-level behavioral plasticity can be just as effective for survival as modifying lower-level responses like heat shock proteins or receptors. On the other hand, if the goal is to breed for a certain trait, behavioral responses may slow down evolution.","1"

"Under natural conditions, the substrate in which BSF females oviposit (lay eggs) is the same one that their larvae will develop on. The “mother knows best” hypothesis suggests that the flies oviposit on a surface that has what the larvae need (nutrient profile, microbiome, moisture). Under artificial conditions, where mating is controlled, eggs are often transferred from the oviposition site to different container for development. The fly has no way of knowing this is the case, though, and must decide whether to lay eggs based on the environment it is currently in.

Understanding the distinct gut communities across different host species and the influence of host ecology can inform practices that support the development and maintenance of specialized microbiomes. Producers involved in bee-dependent agriculture should consider the microbiome diversity of corbiculate bees in managing and promoting pollination services.","1"

"The main insect model used for genetics work is Drosophila (fruit fly). Beetles, like the mealworm, contain over 500,00 species and are separated from the fruit fly by 240 million years (ballpark) of evolution. The red flour beetle (T. castaneum), which is in the same family as mealworms, is a promising alternative to the fruit fly for IAB and researchers invested in a broader range of commercial insects. This paper reviews the state of red flour beetle genetics research and makes a compelling case for their use as a model insect. They also show how genetic data gathered from this beetle may offer more insights into gene function than the fruit fly, because flies have some traits that are unique to that order.","1"

"The genetic landscape of the Black Soldier Fly (BSF) is poorly described in literature. Even with the recent boom of scientific interest, most studies concern feed trials, microbial interactions, and nutritional/chemical profiles. This paper concerns the microRNA profile of the black soldier fly (BSF). MicroRNAs are small single-stranded RNA molecules that don’t code for a protein. Instead, many miRNAs regulate gene expression. Other insect genomics studies have shown that miRNA regulates biological and behavioral functions at different life stages. By understanding microRNA expression in commercial insects like BSF, we will better understand how they adapt to the changes in their environment during mass rearing.","1"

"Transposable elements (TEs) are pieces of DNA that break off from their position on a genome and insert themselves somewhere else, like a virus might. TEs can introduce new functions and studies show that they are major drivers of adaptation. On the other hand, these TEs can insert themselves in the middle of a gene and break them. They can increase or decrease the expression of key genes, leading to potentially negative outcomes. This is why organisms have developed responses to silence the expression of the mobile elements. The authors of this paper show that effective management of TEs is associated with longevity in termite. This could be relevant in two ways. First, while longevity is not necessarily something that’s needed in insects harvested for feed, TE silencing may improve fitness in the longer-lived species like mealworms. Second, longevity may be a goal for those insects selected for egg laying. Consider that the difference between a reproducing queen and a worker is largely driven by differences in gene expression, not genotype. Physiological changes, like enlarged abdomens and the production of fertility-associated lipids and proteins coincide with increased gene expression, during which TE expression must be more tightly managed. It could be possible to breed a longer-lived, perpetually fecund line of BSF, given studies that have already shown evidence of multiple paternity.","1"

"Traditional marker-based methods for detection of variation are inexpensive but miss chromosomal structural variations (SVs). Some existing tools for SV detection can’t capture inversions and translocations. Others can only make predictions if a gene is directly impacted by the SV. Modern interpretations of noncoding DNA have long since moved passed the idea that they are filler or “junk DNA” and are associated with important regulatory functions and the maintenance of chromosomal structure. The black soldier fly is estimated to have 66% repeat content, which does not code for proteins, and over half of the mealworm genome contains a single, massive repeat. There is a great need for the ability to both quantify differences in SVs, coding or otherwise, and connect those differences to a phenotype. The authors of this paper are concerned with human disease, but phenotype can mean any other trait- fast growth, immune function, flavor, nutrition.","1"
"Many discussions on black soldier fly nutrition come from the perspective of identifying an optimal substrate profile in order to maximize performance. In many cases, such as BSF reared on waste streams, an idealized diet may not be achievable. Another route is to adapt the organism to an economically viable food source, either through breeding or direct genetic modification. The ability to change observable traits (phenotypes) in response to a changing environment is called “phenotypic plasticity”. In many animals, males and females have different phenotypic plasticity in response to nutritional changes. The authors of this paper show that female fruit flies grow bigger, faster than males and the insulin pathway is involved.","1"
"This comprehensive review is a great tool for industry members and academics interested in optimizing desired traits within domesticated insect populations.","1"
"Insect behavior is guided by odor cues. It affects everything from mating to diet preference. Olfaction (smelling) involves many receptors, transport proteins, and associated neurons, which means that the metabolic cost of odor sensitivity can be high. Like with most expensive traits, they tend to build up mutations when selection stops favoring them so strongly. The controlled environment of mass rearing has a less complex odor profile, and food/mates are often a few centimeters away, so domestication is likely to result in insects with much different (probably less sensitive) odor detection systems. Studying domestication related olfactory changes can be useful for building fundamental knowledge. Perhaps we can engineer a line of insects that become ravenous when they smell a particular kind of waste. Or maybe an insect can be engineered to mate only when a particular odor enters its containers, allowing for precise life cycle control. This paper describes olfactory related genes in the fruit fly, which has a long history of lab rearing. The insights reported here are likely to translate with other domesticated insect agriculture species.","1"

"When wild species become domesticated, they experience changes in genes and gene expression. Some of these changes are deliberate, commercially desired traits. Others are unintended consequences of population bottle necks (starting with small number of individuals), relaxation of selective pressures (for example, more sterile rearing environment), or the hitchhiking of linked genes. It is possible to unintentionally select for low-fitness traits if the strength of selection is strong, which is often the case with human intervention. There is precedence, in fruit flies, for the breeding of drought tolerance to reducing their mating capability. One advantage of BSF protein is that it can be deployed in water-scarce environments. It is likely that they will be exposed to low humidity conditions as the industry expands in areas like sub-Saharan Africa, or even south Asia, which experiences periodic flooding and dry seasons. This paper shows that, while you might not see a performance gain under mild conditions, breeding for desiccation (drying) resistance will increase mating performance while it is dry.","1"

"The queensland fruit fly is a pest in Australia. It is reared in mass quantities for sterile insect technique, which is a process in which sterile males are released in the wild for population control. Evolutionarily, these flies are very distant to other commercial insects like the black soldier fly or cricket. Practically, they are very similar. A small number are sampled from the wild, they experience strong artificial selection in lab/industry rearing, and their population explodes in number as reproduction is taken over by humans. Domesticated organisms often perform better than their wild counterparts- as long as artificial conditions don’t change and performance is evaluating the same traits that breeding programs act on. Unfortunately, selection can lead to negative changes that aren’t easily observed or take many generations to show themselves. For example, without sequencing, population diversity losses might not lead to observable problems for several generations. Then a pathogen spreads across a rearing facility and, because the insects’ immune systems are so similar, entire colonies must be discarded. This paper discusses the fitness changes in 100+ generation Queensland fruit flies (about 20 years if repeated with mealworms). It provides yet more evidence for the benefits of genetic monitoring and preventative maintenance in colony care.","1"

"The power of artificial selection is obvious in the difference between a chihuahua and a great Dane. Consider that kale, broccoli, and cabbage are derived from the same plant, each selected for a different trait and bred for many generations. Some traits are easy to measure, like body size or growth time, but even these “simple” traits are built upon many interacting proteins. To complicate the problem, many genes are passed on in blocks of DNA (recombination). If one selects for a gene involved in egg laying, they might also get a hitchhiking gene involved in wingspan, simply because it’s physically close in the fly’s DNA. Finally, there are often tradeoffs when selecting a useful trait. For example, a larger larval size might require more development time. Understanding fitness tradeoffs is key to the development of successful breeding programs for BSF. This paper shows that you can get flies to deposit eggs early, the tradeoff being reduced adult lifespan (which is short in BSF anyway).","1"
"A major component of population and functional genetics is comparing DNA sequence data with phenotypic (observable traits) data. For example, one line of insects might produce larger larvae than the rest. Identifying the genetics responsible allows for reproducibility and fine-tuning of this trait. One could insert or breed the large larvae genes into other populations, using markers identified by this research to guide the process. One might find that the large larvae gene comes with unacceptable tradeoffs, and research might uncover a downstream gene more specific to the phenotype and with less side effects. Finally, it is unlikely that a given trait happened upon a perfect optimum for mass rearing. Perhaps it would be more advantageous if a receptor bound a little bit better, or if the gene was expressed a little bit less. These are much easier to affect when we can point to a specific promoter or regulator. Manual collection of detailed, standardized phenotypes for a given sample continues to be important for the statistical analyses that identify candidate genes. Unfortunately, these experiments require trained labor and have the associated throughput limitations. Larger sample size gives more statistical power, which means better results. This paper suggests a “precision phenotyping” approach will improve the speed and standardization of data collection.","1"

"A lot of fundamental research knowledge we have now was furthered by investigators seeking to control pests like mosquitoes, cockroaches, and flies. The red flour beetle is a pest that is related to the mealworm, which makes research advances for that organism highly translatable to insect agriculture. The authors of this paper describe how shutting down a gene called vacht in the red flour beetle led to increased insecticide susceptibility. On one hand, it is possible that genes in this pathway can be manipulated to allow mealworms to feed on waste that has been treated with pesticides. On the other hand, it may be possible to create especially susceptible mealworms. Genetically modified organisms can do great things, but there are always concerns about escapes leading to ecological disturbances. For example, think of the consequences of a black soldier fly engineered for fast growth and extreme hunger hybridizing with local populations and spreading through the country. Perhaps each “super fly” can also come with a lethal gene that only reveals itself in the event of an escape.","1"
"The article explores the relationship between metamorphosis and microbiota in insects, emphasizing the challenges and opportunities faced during this developmental process. Metamorphosis poses unique constraints on maintaining symbiotic relationships, as the larval environment undergoes radical changes, exposing microbes to new conditions and immunological challenges. Some insects retain the same symbiont throughout life stages but may relocate it within different tissues, while others harbor distinct microbial communities in larvae and adults, adapting to shifts in diet or habitat. This flexibility offers advantages over insects with less adaptable associations between life stages. Microbes have been found to influence metamorphosis by protecting against pathogens, supplying essential nutrients for adult development, and regulating pupation cues across various insect taxa. However, microbial associations in many families and orders of Holometabola remain unexplored, leaving room for further discoveries on the intricate relationship between metamorphosis and microbiota in the evolutionary context of animal development.","1"

"High quality assemblies are limited by the number and variety of samples used to construct them.

"The prevailing view of evolution as a linear progression from simple ancestors to complex beings overlooks the intricate nature of biological adaptation.

Perhaps the answer to the threat posed by pests in mass rearing, for example, won’t be found by developing a better local insect strain, but in the chemical arsenals of distantly related bacteria. By investigating the complex mechanisms of adaptation and considering the genetic resources of species outside the Big Three, breeders can surpass what is achievable through conventional breeding alone.","1"

"Phenotypic plasticity is the ability for an organism with the same genotype to respond in different ways, depending on their environment. For example, normally large larvae might be smaller if reared in a dense, nutrient deprived environment. This is fairly intuitive, as one might expect that a nutrient poor insect would have a harder time supporting a bigger body. The question is, how does the body “know” that its environment is different? What specific pathways are up or downregulated to achieve smaller size, or any other adaptation? How can we create larvae that grow faster and larger on available substrates? Unraveling these questions is crucial to engineering an idealized insect. This paper reviews the state of research on developmental plasticity. The authors describe how three major components of environmental responses (sensors, modulators, and effectors) can affect phenotypic plasticity and also targets for future trials.","1"

"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs or SNVs) are relatively easy to quantify with advances in sequencing. Unfortunately, these SNPs do not account for all the ways organisms manifest new traits. The authors of this paper focus on inversions. Traditional marker-based detection often falls short of capturing this variation because, when sequencing reads are mapped to a reference genome, their orientation and alignment are based on the reference sequence. This means inversions, which reverse the original chromosome structure, can be overlooked or misinterpreted as mismatches or gaps, rather than recognized as structural variations. The authors describe methods by which inversions can be reliably characterized, advocating graph-based pangenome, and report on at least 19 cases of inversions associated with adaptation and commercially useful traits in cash crops.","1"
"Microbial diversity of these diets may play a huge role in the diet preference of the larvae.

"Domestication leads to changes, deliberate and accidental, to an organism’s genome. The sampling of a small number of organisms for mass rearing creates population bottlenecks that reduce population diversity. Humans often impose environmental conditions that are drastically different from the wild, which further limits available genetic material as selection favors a narrow set of traits. The process of domestication is often understood from the context of successful domesticates like dogs and cows, but the authors of this paper show that the vast majority of species fail to adapt. The big three insect agriculture species (BSF, cricket, mealworm) were selected in part because they perform well in human conditions. It is important to note, though, that dogs had more than 10,000 years of selection to get where they are today. By refining a generalized understanding of domestication, one can improve upon the traits granted by natural selection and ensure that a species of interest becomes a successful domesticate.","1"

"One subject of increasing controversy is the origin of the black soldier fly. Scientific consensus is that the BSF originated in the new world and very recently spread to the rest of the globe. Recent mitochondrial data call this into question, with the migration and branching of Old-World black soldier flies predicted to have occurred at least several million years ago- long before the evolution of homo sapiens. In a similar vein, early sightings of the black soldier fly in Europe suggested that it was introduced by human trade and migration in the 20th century. This paper reports on an alleged black soldier fly larva that was found in the tomb of a 16th century Italian princess, which would place the BSF in Europe at least four centuries prior. This sample has not been sequenced, which could be useful both to positively ID the specimen as BSF and to gain more insight into the black soldier fly’s historical demographics and genetic adaptations. Such information is crucial for improving BSF breeding and management, ultimately enhancing the productivity and sustainability of insect agriculture","1"

"This paper is relevant to insect growers because it investigates the bioaccumulation potential of certain micro- and macroelements, toxic elements, and non-essential elements in the black soldier fly (H. illucens) raised on optimal feed. This information is important for insect growers who are interested in using H. illucens as a potential source of protein for animal feed or human food. Understanding the bioaccumulation potential of H. illucens is essential for ensuring the safety of the final product and meeting regulatory requirements. The study provides valuable information that can be used by insect growers to optimize their feeding practices and reduce the risk of bioaccumulation of harmful elements in their insect-based products. By ensuring the safety and quality of their products, insect growers can build consumer trust and expand the market for insect-based food and feed.","1"

"Insect agriculture producers should take note of this research as it demonstrates the indirect effects of global warming on pest insects. The study specifically shows that elevated temperatures can negatively impact the southern green stinkbug by suppressing its obligate bacterial symbiont.

Insect farmers may need to consider the potential cascading effects of climate change on symbiotic relationships within insect populations, impacting pest dynamics and requiring adaptation strategies.","1"
"In insect agriculture, it is occasionally necessary to transport live organisms, like shipping a box for sequencing. For small scales like this, it is simple to add some dry ice to a styrofoam box. On a larger scale, climate-controlled containers can be costly. One solution could be inducing diapause, which is a physiological state like hibernation where development stops and body processes slow down. Manipulating diapause could also allow for better control of production cycles and harvesting times. As opposed to hibernation, diapause under natural conditions tends to be uninterrupted and non-reversible, but it can be artificially interrupted with treatments like the hydrochloric acid solution used in this paper. The authors show the altered expression levels of different sugar transport genes caused by diapause, which will help characterize the mechanisms involved. If the genes involved in diapause are understood more fully, cheaper and more elegant techniques could be developed to manipulate insect life cycles.","1"

"Invertebrates lack the sophisticated adaptive immune system of vertebrate agriculture species like pigs, chickens, and cow. This means that they rely heavily on innate immunity, and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are one of the most important molecules in that system. Insects also rely on mutualistic bacteria, and AMPs can damage the insect’s own cells. Evolution favors a balance between too much activity, destroying the host and “good” bacteria, and too little, making them vulnerable to pathogens. The authors of this paper focus on a single fruit fly amp, Diptericin, and show how evolution has impacted it. In their introduction, they describe cases where insects that transition to more sterile environments partially or completely lose immune function. This is especially relevant to insect agriculture where, at the very least, the kind of pathogens encountered in commercial rearing are likely to be different from the wild. It is important to understand how we might be inadvertently promoting risks to colony health. Conversely, by leveraging mechanistic insights into AMP adaptation, we may be able to enhance disease tolerance through genomic breeding or through genetic modification. After all, each insect species or population is exposed to a unique environment and will likely be uniquely well-equipped to handle a specific range of pathogens.","1"

"The early stages of fly development are determined by mRNA that is deposited in the egg by the mother. This is one way that the environment of the mother (for example, good or bad nutrition) can affect the growth of their larvae. Recent Drosophila (fruit fly) studies have shown that, on an individual level, the larval developmental diet may be more important than maternal diet for determining larval fitness. It is important to consider, though, that BSF females can lay hundreds of eggs. The accumulation of small benefits, across many larvae, could still be significant when measuring total output.","1"

"This study explored the composition and establishment of microbiomes associated with eggs of the Southern green stinkbug, Nezara viridula (L.). Researchers employed high-throughput amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR to investigate the microbiome of egg masses from natural populations in Belgium and Italy, as well as to analyze eggs at different developmental stages from laboratory strains. Results revealed that eggs from ovaries lacked bacteria, suggesting bacterial colonization occurred post-oviposition. The bacterial diversity of deposited eggs was notably low, with minimal changes observed in bacterial composition and density over time, implying limited bacterial growth. Notably, a Pantoea-like symbiont, previously identified in the midgut of N. viridula, was consistently present at high densities in most samples, indicating its dominance within the egg-associated microbiome. Furthermore, some eggs contained a Sodalis symbiont, previously unreported in N. viridula populations. Overall, the study concludes that the microbiome associated with N. viridula eggs is characterized by low diversity and is predominantly dominated by a few specific symbiotic bacteria, notably the Pantoea-like symbiont, suggesting its importance in the ecology of N. viridula eggs.","1"

"Reference genomes are the backbone of modern genetics work. High quality assemblies lead to better prediction of gene structure, a better understanding of the species demographic history, and offer a resource for functional genomics work. For example, the design of candidate regions for CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic modifications necessitates an understanding of the genome's topography to minimize off-target effects. The authors of this paper constructed a genome assembly using a novel technique known as Omni-C, which is less biased than Hi-C in its selection of regions due to the restriction enzymes it employs, to investigate chromosomal structure. Their final product was lower quality than the black soldier fly reference assembly, but still better than most other non-model insects. Also, insights might be gained from differences between these genomes. The NCBI reference came from the Sheppard strain, from North America, while the authors of this paper sourced BSF reared in Taiwan. Recent mitochondrial evidence suggests that Asian BSF occupy a separate lineage, so it is possible that this assembly contains variants not found in others.","1"

"Many commercial insects are marketed as a way of recycling food. Food waste streams aren’t homogenous, though, meaning that the insect is expected to eat spent beer grains with the same efficiency that it eats liquified tomatoes. Commercial insects are usually taken from the wild and domesticated, a process where humans control breeding and living conditions. The growing consensus on domestication is that it leads to a loss of genetic diversity. Having a genetically diverse population of black soldier flies means that there are many individuals that, by random chance, are better or worse at processing a certain kind of waste. At the time of writing, there weren’t many studies on the role, specifically, that diversity plays in ecological interactions and how it might affect an insect’s fitness. Will a genetically diverse population be able to take advantage of a mixed waste stream? The answer is unclear for BSF, but there are some fitness advantages in the case of the seed beetle.","1"
"When wild species are introduced to a laboratory environment, changes are often observed in genetic diversity, gene expression, and microbiome composition. Not all genetic changes are bad, and some are deliberately selected for, but reduction in diversity can reduce fitness in species undergoing mass rearing. In addition, introduction of artificial diets (like Gainsville) can disrupt the microbiome, which is especially bad for insects, like the black soldier fly, which rely on symbiotic bacteria for survival and health. Unlike many other species, Drosophila suziki (fruit fly) has thrived in lab rearing. So, why does one organism do better than another when placed in a new environment? If CEIF can find the answer, perhaps it can be applied to existing stock through genetic modification or changes in rearing practices.","1"
"The authors of this paper argue that silkworms are the only fully domesticated insect. That is a subject of debate, but one thing is certain: silkworms have been selectively bred for many centuries. Many problems currently faced in commercial insect rearing were encountered before the founding of Rome, the Great Wall of China, and the construction of ancient Egyptian pyramids. Silkworms are a good resource for best practices, based on this history, but they are also good examples of what happens to insects under modern breeding programs.

"Ducks were domesticated about 2000 years ago and are separated from insect agriculture species by hundreds of millions of years. Though there are obvious differences between insects and birds in general, the similarities between some species are especially relevant to IAB interests. Controlled breeding and high-density rearing has reduced male-male competition, which in turn lowers the pressure of males to maintain certain genes. Mass reared insects face similar conditions which may also lead to changes in genes related to sexual selection. It is important to understand how artificial conditions will affect the insect’s genetics- both to avoid potential problems and to take advantage of beneficial adaptations.","1"

"Black soldier flies, mealworms, and crickets were all taken from a wild and relatively diverse population and introduced to a new environment (like labs or commercial rearing) with a small number of founding individuals. Changes like these are associated with a loss of genetic diversity and increase in inbreeding depression.

Another approach is to look at invasive and endangered species introduced by humans, which also started from a small founding population and needed to adapt to a different environment.","1"
"Commercial black soldier fly samples are relatively simple to acquire, due to industry partnerships, but wild sightings of black soldier flies are rare and, to date, all wild BSF samples used in CEIF genetic resource database (GRD) were acquired from residential compost. These contacts were often made through science outreach and local connections. The authors of this paper demonstrate the power of citizen science, which involved the recruitment of non-academic volunteers to provide wasp samples for a population survey. Organizing similar efforts with BSF would be beneficial in two ways. First, it would provide access to a diverse range of samples that might be difficult to acquire otherwise. Diversity means more gene variants, which means more useful traits to breed into commercial lines. Second, citizen outreach is likely to improve the relationship between the public and insect agriculture. It is no secret that many people are disgusted by the idea of insect protein, a perception that might be improved with more exposure.","1"

"One way of managing the nutrient profile of black soldier fly (fat, protein, micronutrient content) is by changing the rearing diet. In some cases, though, optimal substrate may either be unavailable, because they are feeding on waste, or less economical to source. Another approach is to directly affect how insects produce, store, and metabolize industrially useful nutrients. It is helpful to look at information on Drosophila (fruit fly), one of the most investigated model organisms in the fly order (Diptera). Still, a lot of evolutionary distance separates Drosophilidae (fruit/vinegar flies) and Stratiomyidae (soldier flies). There is very limited knowledge on the genetic basis for these processes in black soldier fly. Papers that directly study BSF genetics are rare, despite increased interest in the species as an alternative protein, and are valuable to the IAB for guiding future trials.","1"

"In general, inbreeding is associated with a decrease in genetic diversity, increase in harmful recessive traits, and decrease in population fitness. On the other hand, the tendency of inbreeding to increase homozygosity (same version of a gene from both parents) can concentrate the “bad” genes in a subset of individuals. If many children are produced, and the sacrifice of some of them isn’t a problem, inbreeding can potentially be used to screen out low quality genes. It is the opinion of the writer that, overall, more harm is done than good, but it is important to recognize results that contradict expectations. The authors of this paper show that 20 generations of selective inbreeding actually led to improved egg production without affecting other important traits.","1"

"This study is relevant to insect growers because it highlights the importance of understanding the role of microbiomes in insects' physiology, health, and fitness. Insect growers often rear insects for various purposes, such as food production, waste management, and research, and the microbiome of insects can play a crucial role in their performance and productivity. Understanding the factors that shape the microbiome of insects, such as resource availability, density, and microbial interactions, can help insect growers optimize their rearing practices and improve the efficiency and quality of their insect production. This study of the red flour beetle, an important insect model, found that the beetle's microbiome is derived from flour-acquired microbes and varies depending on resource availability and density. The study also found that the beetle gains multiple fitness benefits from its microbiome, such as higher fecundity, egg survival, and lifespan, as well as reduced cannibalism. These findings suggest that maintaining a healthy microbiome in reared insects can improve their performance and productivity. Additionally, the study found that the microbiome is not essential for beetle survival and development under any tested conditions, suggesting that manipulating the microbiome of reared insects may be a viable strategy for optimizing insect production. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between insects and their microbiomes, and can aid insect growers in developing strategies to optimize their rearing practices.","1"

"A population bottle neck is a rapid loss of diversity due to a reduction in population size- the same thing that happens every time a small number of insects are removed from the wild population to start a production line. Population genetics work is effective for measuring inbreeding or predicting bottlenecks when they have already occurred. What you get is a snapshot of the current population state and, if you are lucky, enough information to work backwards in time. The authors of this paper use computer modeling to simulate what would happen to an imaginary population under many different conditions. The projections don’t say much about a specific group or production strain, but they can help scientists understand more about the biological processes involved. This allows for generalizations that can be improved upon as more strain specific data is acquired. The other advantage of computer simulations is that they are cheaper and allow you to observe a number of generations that would be impractical in the real world. For example, repeating the experiment in this study for live mealworms would take 333 years of continuous breeding.","1"
"The genetic landscape of the Black Soldier Fly (BSF) is poorly described in literature. Even with the recent boom of scientific interest; most studies concern feed trials, microbial interactions, and nutritional/chemical profiles. This paper tackled many aspects of BSF genetics, genome assembly, gene expression, microbiome composition, gene editing, and trait optimization. It is relevant to IAB as a starting point for more focused studies. For example, one that investigates the large number of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) identified in BSF and how they may improve host health.","1"

"The paper's findings could be relevant to insect growers because it highlights the importance of a healthy gut microbiome for the growth and development of black soldier fly larvae, which are commonly used in insect farming for producing animal feed and fertilizer. The study suggests that dysbiotic states induced by nutrient-poor diets can lead to reduced insect weight and size and longer developmental stages, which could have negative implications for insect growers' production efficiency. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of maintaining stable and well-connected bacterial interactomes in the gut microbiome, which could be relevant for developing strategies to improve the health and productivity of insects in commercial settings.","1"
"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs or SNVs), which represent places on a genome that differ by one A, C, T, or G between samples, are relatively easy to quantify with advances in sequencing. Unfortunately, these SNPs do not account for all the ways organisms manifest new traits. Large chromosomal sections of a genome may break off, duplicate, or appear in reverse order. DNA structures called mobile or transposable elements break from their position on a genome and reinsert themselves somewhere else. Traditional marker-based detection of variation has trouble capturing this information, even where only SNP data is needed, because it relies on linearly mapping DNA to a single reference that is unlikely to represent an entire species. This paper describes pangenomics, which compares whole genomes with each other, and how it is already being applied in crop research to solve problems that marker-based approaches fall short in addressing.","1"
"Artificial selection is a powerful tool for promoting commercially important traits, like body size, nutrition profile, and mating capability. On the other hand, selection cannot create traits from nothing. All it can do is promote variants that already exist in a population, or work to remove them if they are less useful. This is why considerations such as starting population size and population diversity, which increase that chance that you have a beneficial variant in a population, are so important. Also, this imposes limitations on what artificial selection can or cannot achieve. It is unlikely, for example, that breeding trials alone will produce elephant-sized, photosynthesizing crickets. At some point, it becomes less costly to fulfill a certain function with a different species, rather than expending resources on adapting existing stock. For this reason, it may be important to expand commercial stock to accommodate a larger variety of waste inputs. This review paper describes the big three bio converters (BSF, cricket, mealworm), some alternative species (such as the codling moth and housefly), and recommendations for the development of new breeding programs.","1"
"In the traditional Darwinian model, pressure from the environment combined with resource scarcity results in slow changes to behavior and morphology (body shape). For example, with the beaks of finches adapting to the kind of food available on a given island by growing differently shaped beaks. Mendel, a contemporary of Darwin, showed that the inheritance of traits like beak length follows a mathematical pattern. For a long time, biologists understood that this was mediated by genetics and was a one-way flow from DNA (the manual) to RNA (the instructions) to proteins (the resulting product) which we call the central dogma. Recently, we have come to understand that there is a complex web of information exchange between each step. Epigenetics describes changes that don’t alter the DNA sequence but are stable and can be inherited. The epigenome is just as relevant as the genome when studying an insect. In fact, most domestication related changes in the short-term act on regulatory genes, which don’t code for proteins but can affect how an organism produces them. This paper reviews how epigenetics affects animal personality. Personality, used here to describe a predisposition to a certain set of behaviors, can affect things like feeding and mating activity that might, in turn, affect production.","1"

"When wild species are introduced to a laboratory environment, changes are often observed in genetic diversity, gene expression, and microbiome composition. Not all genetic changes are bad, and some are deliberately selected for, but a reduction in diversity can also reduce fitness in species undergoing mass rearing. The BSF industry is new, but there are other species that IAB can look to as an example of what is to come or, in the case of this paper, what is happening now in industrial strains. This paper concerns the genetic diversity of the predatory mite, Amblyseius swirskii, which has been commercially mass reared since 2005.","1"
"When wild species are introduced to a laboratory environment, changes are often observed in genetic diversity, gene expression, and microbiome composition. Not all genetic changes are bad, and some are deliberately selected for, but a reduction in diversity is associated with reduced fitness, an effect called inbreeding depression. In addition to fitness costs, a small and homogeneous population is more vulnerable to genetic drift, which is the tendency of genes to either be fixed or lost in a population. These risks apply to any domesticated species but insects like the black soldier fly are especially vulnerable. They are r-selected species, which means that they produce many young and have very short lifespans. For example, it is possible to cycle through 6 full BSF generations in the time it takes for a cow to produce a calf. This allows for rapid changes in population characteristics. Knowledge on BSF genetics is scarce, though, and papers like this are critical to understanding best practices for genetic management and selective breeding.","1"
"The authors of this paper demonstrate that both wild and commercial black soldier fly populations largely separate into two lineages, with lineage a representing North American BSF and lineage b covering the rest. This information is useful in informing breeding practices, as population substructure can confound research results. For example, if lineage a BSF grow faster with a certain protein ratio, while lineage b grows slower, a trial that originates in North America might falsely predict optimal conditions when generalized to BSF in Europe or Asia. This paper also highlighted regions in the black soldier fly genome that should be of great interest to BSF breeders. They might be key factors driving success in captivity, like better growth or stronger immunity. On the other hand, these traits could also be part of what's known as 'domestication syndrome,' where certain negative characteristics, like reproductive problems or reduced immunity, appear. By investigating these candidate regions, we can identify which traits are beneficial and should be maintained in breeding programs, and which might be harmful and need to be carefully managed or bred out for the health and well-being of the species","1"

"The power of artificial selection is obvious in the difference between a chihuahua and a great Dane. Consider that kale, broccoli, and cabbage are derived from the same plant, each selected for a different trait and bred for many generations. Some traits are easy to measure, like body size or growth time, but even these “simple” traits are built upon many interacting proteins. To complicate the problem, many genes are passed on in blocks of DNA (recombination). If one selects for a gene involved in egg laying, they might also get a hitchhiking gene involved in wingspan, simply because it is physically close in the fly’s DNA. That is one reason a breeding program might produce insects that have both increased fecundity (fertility) and increased disease susceptibility. In this paper, long-term artificial selection successfully produced large mealworms, but the tradeoff was reduced larval survival.","1"
"RT-qPCR is a very common way to express differential gene expression. In order for these assays to be reliable, it is imparative that you are using reference genes that are stable across all variables that are being tested. life stage and UVB exposure are variables that insects in food and feed researchers likely will be contending with. ","1"
"When wild species become domesticated, they experience changes in genes and gene expression. Some of these changes are deliberate, commercially desired traits. Others are unintended consequences of population bottle necks (starting with small number of individuals), relaxation of selective pressures (for example, more sterile rearing environment), or the hitchhiking of linked genes. Reduced genetic diversity is one common result of domestication. A small and homogeneous population is more vulnerable to genetic drift, which is the tendency of genes to either be fixed or lost in a population. Even if a gene is “good”, it can still be lost from a population through random chance if its frequency is low enough. The same is true for “bad” genes, which can become fixed even when they cause harm. In this case, the authors show one positive outcome of domestication; an increased sexual performance in domesticated males. Identifying which genes are under selection, and therefore responsible for the performance increase, could allow IAB to replicate the author’s success in other mass reared species.","1"
"Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, is a model organism for genetics with a long history of research. Insights into black soldier fly genetics can be drawn from what is already known from its distant cousin. Like the black soldier fly and all other insects, fruit flies don’t have an adaptive immune system. They don’t have memory cells, for example, that allow for vaccines in vertebrates like pigs, chickens, and cows. As a result, research promoting pathogen tolerance must rely on improvements on the innate immune system. The authors show how 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), which has homologs in the black soldier fly, works to regulate innate immunity in the fruit fly. The 20e gene is so highly networked that modifying it for improvement programs could create problems. Evidence in this review, though, suggests that manipulating its downstream targets could improve survival in the event of a pathogen outbreak in mass rearing.","1"

"Artificial selection is a powerful tool to alter an organism, but it comes with some challenges. Some traits are easy to measure, like body size or growth time, but even these “simple” traits are built upon many interacting proteins. To complicate the problem, many genes are passed on through mixing chunks of DNA (recombination). If one selects strongly for a gene involved in egg laying, they might also get a hitchhiking gene variant with reduced disease tolerance, simply because the two genes are close together on the DNA strand. This is why insect breeding must be done with more care than picking out the fastest growing larvae. Unfortunately, though the cricket market is expected to be worth billions within the decade, comparatively little research is invested in cricket genetics and genomics.

"This study is relevant to insect growers because it highlights the potential impacts of elevated tropospheric ozone concentrations on plant communities and their associated insects and microbes. As insects often depend on plants for food and shelter, changes in plant communities can have significant effects on insect populations and their interactions with other organisms. The study suggests that elevated ozone concentrations can affect plant communities by altering their physiology, foliar chemistry, and volatiles, which can in turn affect plant-insect interactions and insect community composition. These effects can have indirect impacts on insect growers by reducing the availability and quality of insect food sources and altering insect pest populations. The study also notes that elevated ozone concentrations can disrupt plant-soil-microbe interactions, leading to changes in nutrient cycling and decomposition rates, which can have further implications for insect growers who rely on these processes for maintaining soil health and plant growth. Furthermore, the study identifies several regions with high endemic richness that are at high ozone risk by 2100, including parts of Asia and Africa, which are important regions for insect production and biodiversity. Thus, understanding the potential impacts of elevated ozone concentrations on plant communities and their associated insects and microbes is critical for insect growers to develop effective management strategies and maintain the health and productivity of their insect populations.","1"

"The silkworm industry, and its model organism, is useful for informing best practices in the management and analysis of modern commercial insects. Silkworms have been domesticated for thousands of years. Their breeding programs have led to major increases in silk production, but, at the time of writing, very little was known about the genetic mechanisms that are responsible. A similar problem exists with black soldier flies, crickets, and mealworms. Feed trials and breeding have already shown performance increases. All of the big three species lack the large genetic databases common for well investigated species like drosophila and humans. Without understanding, mechanistically, how a given strain achieves its phenotype (observable traits), it can be challenging to maintain the traits in new or hybrid lines.

"The study investigated the influence of gut bacteria on Drosophila melanogaster's fitness traits. It highlighted that interactions among bacteria play a crucial role in shaping host fitness, impacting aspects like development, reproduction, and lifespan. Through experiments with various combinations of five core gut bacteria, researchers discovered that bacterial diversity accelerated development, reproduction, and aging, although increased reproduction led to shorter lifespans. The study utilized mathematical models adapted from genetic epistasis to measure the impact of bacterial interactions on fly fitness. Results showed that higher diversity correlated with development and reproduction, whereas lifespan and microbiome abundances were highly reliant on bacterial species interactions. These interactions, detected in 13-44% of cases, influenced multiple traits, reflecting life history tradeoffs. The findings indicated that these interactions were context-dependent and held significant importance akin to individual bacterial species within gut microbiomes.","1"
"This study aimed to characterize the bacterial communities within the midguts of tsetse flies collected from various locations in Kenya and Uganda and explore their associations with African trypanosome infections. Utilizing both culture-dependent and independent methods, researchers isolated and sequenced bacterial strains from different tsetse species captured at distinct sites in Kenya. The obligate endosymbiont Wigglesworthia was identified as the most abundant bacterium within the midgut of G. pallidipes, persisting consistently regardless of trypanosome infection status. Additionally, Sodalis, a commensal symbiont, exhibited significantly higher densities in trypanosome-infected flies compared to uninfected ones. Field-captured G. pallidipes displayed distinct and low-density communities of environmentally acquired microbes in their midguts, with variations in taxonomic structure associated with parasite infection and geographic location. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between tsetse flies, their microbiota, and trypanosome vector competence, potentially guiding the development of innovative disease control strategies or enhancing existing ones.","1"

"Genome assemblies are the backbone of modern genetics research. DNA is generally sequenced as fragments, called reads, which must be put together in the right order so that scientists can draw conclusions about the data. Model organisms have high quality references, which these reads can be mapped to, but those of many non-model organisms are low-quality or absent. The authors of this paper build an improved mealworm assembly, which will facilitate further explorative genetics research in insect agriculture. They also develop a reporter system for genetic modification that can be used to test new traits that might not otherwise be visible. For example, a GMO mealworm might be injected with something that improves metabolism using this system. The reporter will change the mealworm’s eye color or make it glow under a UV lamp, to tell the breeder that the GMO gene is actively expressed. This paper provides a valuable resource for researchers in insect agriculture to follow up on. Also, future efforts could focus on the creation of a high-quality genome assembly for crickets, expanding the genetic research toolkit available for edible insects.","1"

Using advanced sequencing techniques, the study revealed the bacterial composition in both adult and immature stages of the insect, along with the decomposed substrate, when exposed to the pathogen. Surprisingly, the introduced Salmonella did not significantly alter the microbial patterns in either the insect or the substrate, which were primarily dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The study also observed the transmission of the pathogen from wild adults to the second generation, indicating a potential role of these insects in spreading foodborne bacteria. Overall, this research enhances our understanding of microbial dynamics in decomposing environments, shedding light on the potential application of microbes for estimating postmortem intervals and studying the transmission of pathogenic bacteria.","1"

"The Darwinian concept of “survival of the fittest” is often misinterpreted in the context of single fit individual. The truth is that evolution acts on, and is evaluated based on, the genetics of a whole population. Progress of evolution is based on the mechanics of random chance as much as natural selection, too. If a version of a gene is present in low frequency, it is likely to be lost regardless of how fit it makes an individual. For example, consider a situation where one single male cricket was born with genes that made it twice as big, fast growing, and delicious as any other in the entire production facility (high fitness, low frequency allele). There’s a chance that the sheer number of competing males prevents it from mating at all. Consider what would happen if the mating line was not selected randomly, but instead they just grabbed a convenient clump of neonates within reach (population bottleneck/founder effect). The odds of the super cricket gene spreading becomes lower. What if there are much more males than females (skewed gender ratio) or if constant outbreeding introduces wild crickets (gene flow) that lack a supergene? What if all wild imported crickets have the supergene? These considerations and more are described in population genetics by the term “effective population size” or Ne. These factors affecting the realistic number of mating pairs, and how their genes spread through a population, must be considered as much as any environmental conditions or genetics modifications used to develop a trait.","1"

"Domestication leads to changes, deliberate and accidental, to the organisms' genome. Humans often desire traits, and impose environmental conditions, that are drastically different from the wild. Previous research has shown that silkworm domestication leads to changes in genes associated with nitrogen and amino acid synthesis. This makes sense, because both are needed for the rapid growth associated with commercial rearing. This paper investigates how artificial selection on the silkworm modifies the storage protein 1 gene (which affects nitrogen storage) to increase egg hatchability. This knowledge may be transferrable to other commercial insects to improve breeding programs. It is possible to breed better insects without any knowledge of the underlying genetics. For example, one doesn't need to know about the insulin pathway to pick the largest larvae in the group. Some traits are harder to visually inspect, though, and there is always room for improvement. By understanding which genes are targeted during insect domestication, we can invest minimal time and resources on optimizing a few candidates that will give the greatest impact.","1"
"The silkworm industry is several thousand years old. Much research has already been done to characterize pathogens and parasites that prey on them, such as the BmNPV studied in this paper. As knowledge about insect agriculture pathogens grows, and more opportunistic infectious agents fill the niche created by mass rearing, it may be necessary to directly target the most problematic ones. One approach is to reduce the production of viruses by covering up (or destroying) expressed genes with complementary RNA. This blocks more viral proteins from being made. The authors found that targeting multiple viral genes was much more effective an any single gene. Developing the right cocktail may take some work with BSF, crickets, and mealworms, but doing so may greatly improve survival if they encounter a viral challenge.","1"

"The study provides valuable insights into the gut microbial symbionts of Spodoptera littoralis, a notorious agricultural pest. The findings suggest that the gut microbiome plays a critical role in the nutrition, physiology, and behavior of the pest during different life stages. Understanding the metabolic activity of these microbial symbionts may assist the development of novel pest-management strategies. Insect growers can benefit from the knowledge of the gut microbiome of agricultural pests as it can provide a better understanding of their life cycle, enabling the development of targeted pest-management strategies that are more effective and eco-friendly.","1"
"One way to increase size is adding more food to rearing containers or optimizing its nutrient profile. Ultimately, mass gains are limited by how many calories are absorbed by the insect, which is influenced by feeding behavior. The insulin signaling pathway is associated with growth and survival but, the time of writing, it wasn’t known how insulin signaling affects feeding behavior or which genes were involved in turning it on. One way that biologists identify the genes behind an observed trait is through GS mutants. DNA is inserted randomly into a fly genome, which has a chance of breaking genes. When a gene stops working, the fly might have an observable defect like small body size or no wings. If a trait is scientifically or commercially relevant, it is possible to determine where the insertion happened and, by extension, which genes are responsible. This paper uses GS mutants to identify a gene responsible for feeding behavior, which (in the context of IAB) might be useful for developing insects that have greater appetite for the mass rearing substrate.","1"

"Domestication leads to changes, deliberate and accidental, to an organism’s genome. The sampling of a small number of organisms for mass rearing creates population bottlenecks that reduce population diversity. Humans often impose environmental conditions that are drastically different from the wild, which further limits available genetic material as selection favors a narrow set of traits. The silkworm is arguably the only fully domesticated insect species, so the industry is a good resource to understand what domestication might look like for newly added species. Domestication related behavioral changes are common across the animal kingdom. For example, commercial silkworms have an absent or suppressed climbing instinct, which makes them easier to handle in mass rearing. The authors of this paper show that viruses like BmNPV (a common silkworm pathogen) increase dopamine levels to enhance wandering and foraging. Perhaps dopamine signaling can be adjusted to either decrease movement, reducing escapes and creating more manageable insects, or increase it, promoting feeding behavior or facilitating self-collection.","1"

"This study holds substantial significance for insect producers, offering a pivotal opportunity to expand their market presence in animal feed production. By showcasing the efficacy of insect-based meals, such as Hermetia illucens, as substitutes for traditional feed ingredients like fish meal or soy in aquafeeds, producers can diversify their product offerings beyond niche markets. The study's validation of Hermetia illucens meal (H) in enhancing gut microbiota, growth performance, and immune responses in fish underscores the sustainability and nutritional value of insect-derived feeds. This positions insect producers to emphasize their products' eco-friendly nature, promoting collaborations with aquafeed manufacturers and stimulating further research into optimizing insect-based feed formulations for various animal species. Overall, these findings provide a compelling case for insect producers, enabling them to leverage the growing demand for sustainable and effective alternatives in animal feed production.","1"
"For insect producers, particularly those involved in agriculture or pest management, understanding how insects adapt to novel host plants is crucial. This study specifically investigates the gut microbiome of the cucurbit frugivorous fruit fly, Zeugodacus cucurbitae, when it shifts its feeding preferences from its usual cucurbit host to Solanum melongena (an unconventional host). The findings highlight that the gut microbiome undergoes subtle yet significant changes when the fly shifts to a different host plant. This suggests that alterations in diet and local environmental factors play a crucial role in shaping the diversity and composition of the insect gut microbiome. Identifying specific bacterial genera responsible for these changes offers insights for insect producers dealing with pest management strategies.

"Natural light cycles vary with the seasons and are affected by local conditions like weather. As humans urbanize and electrify, the night sky grows increasingly bright, with negative effects on wild insects. The connection between light cycles and biological cycles, circadian rhythms, is well documented and there is evidence of bright light exposure resulting in changes to gene expression. The authors of this paper measure transcriptional activity in response to low-light pollution to study how humans are affecting wildlife. Commercial insects live in more controlled environments, but this study shows that you don’t need a lot of light to disrupt circadian rhythms. Nor does it require constant output of light. A 30-minute pulse of 2lx (brightness level) was enough to alter transcription levels of key genes related to biological clocks. By comparison, artificial light indoors is usually 300-500lx, so this could easily be caused by a technician with a flashlight.","1"

"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs or SNVs) are relatively easy to quantify with advances in sequencing. Unfortunately, these SNPs do not account for all the ways organisms manifest new traits. Large chromosomal sections of a genome may break off, duplicate, or appear in reverse order. DNA structures called mobile or transposable elements break from their position on a genome and reinsert themselves somewhere else. Traditional marker-based detection of variation falls short in capturing this information, but graphical pangenomics might be a solution. Graphical pangenomics is a cutting-edge field in which the genome is represented by a web of connections rather than a line, allowing breeders to make informed decisions about value a of genotype in the context of the entire species. This paper describes structural variations, which are more easily identified by graphical approaches, and how they drive adaptive changes that improve crop production. Though the authors focused on plants, the same genetic mechanisms govern adaptation in insect agriculture species.","1"

"Artificial selection is a powerful tool for promoting commercially important traits, like body size, nutrition profile, and mating capability. On the other hand, selection is a process of trial and error that must be executed over many generations. More importantly, selection cannot create traits from nothing. All it can do is promote variants that already exist in a population, or work to remove them if they are less useful. So, what should be done in non-idealized conditions, where genetic diversity is low, or the variant is completely absent in the global population? One solution is directly modifying the insect genome through techniques such as Crispr/Cas9. In some cases, it means transferring a gene segment that already exists in a species. On other cases, you can pull in genes from different species or insert synthetic genes. For example, researchers inserted black soldier fly antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes into silkworms, resulting in higher survival rate in a bacterial challenge.","1"

"Transposons, also known as transposable elements (TEs) or mobile DNA, are pieces of DNA that cut or copy themselves and add their sequence to another part of the genome. They play a pivotal role in domestication, breeding, and evolution in general, so understanding TEs is essential for harnessing a species' genetic potential. This paper delves deep into the behavior of different kinds of TES and the places in the genome they are known to be found. At minimum, understanding the nature of TEs helps researchers understand adaptations, which can point to candidates for genomic based breeding programs. Also, most insertions are deleterious and are heavily selected against. Some studies have shown that better silencing of TEs is associated with the longer-lived queen termite queens, compared with workers. This is especially relevant for those that rear mealworms, which have an abnormally large stretch of satellite DNA that was at least partially mediated by TEs.","1"

"This review delves into the concept of symbiogenesis, where various organisms coexist permanently to form a holobiont - the host and its associated microbiota. The holobiome, comprising the host genome and microbiome genes, represents the intricate network of symbiotic interactions between a host and its microbiota. Eukaryotic individuals are viewed as tightly integrated prokaryotic communities, suggesting that natural selection operates on the holobiont as a unified unit. Insects have extensively studied holobionts, indicating symbioses as a driving force in insect diversification.

"The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), employed globally for managing pest fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae), hinges on the successful copulation of mass-reared sterilized males with wild fertile females upon field release. A critical literature analysis was conducted on the tephritid gut microbiome, covering methods for microbiota identification, including next-generation sequencing, the impacts of irradiation and rearing, and the use of probiotics to modulate the fruit fly gut microbiota. Processes such as domestication, mass-rearing, and irradiation, integral to SIT, can alter the structure of fruit flies' gut microbial communities compared to wild counterparts. Tephritid gut microbiota play pivotal roles in host development, performance, and physiology, but understanding the impact of mass-rearing on microbial communities and their functional role remains limited. Probiotics show promise in cultivating gut microbial communities that combat pathogens and enhance fruit fly quality. Technological advancements in identifying and characterizing gut microbiota, including genomics and metagenomics, are expanding insights into tephritid gut microbial diversity and functions. The manipulation of gut microbiota through probiotics presents substantial opportunities to elevate the production of high-quality, effective fruit flies for operational SIT programs.","1"

"Sex ratio is important in commercial insect production for a lot of reasons. Studies in Mexican fruit flies have shown that fertility can be affected by density and sex ratio, with the presence of too many males having a negative impact. On the other hand, a skewed sex ratio can lead to a lower effective population size. This means that the population is more likely to be inbred and is more vulnerable to genetic drift, a process that can lock in bad genes or remove good ones- even if your breeding is acting in the opposite direction. The ideal male/female ratio is a combination of many factors and varies depending on the goal of the breeder. For these reasons, it's important to not only understand the pros and cons of a sex bias, but how to control it in an organism for the intended application. The authors study flea beetles (like mealworm/superworm) infect with Wolbachia, which is a bacteria that is known to affect sex ratio in many insects.","1"

"Insect behavior is guided by odor cues. It affects everything from mating to diet preference. Olfaction (smelling) involves many receptors, transport proteins, and associated neurons, which means that the metabolic cost of odor sensitivity can be high. Like with most expensive traits, they tend to build up mutations when selection stops favoring them so strongly. The controlled environment of mass rearing has a less complex odor profile, and food/mates are often a few centimeters away, so domestication is likely to result in insects with much different (probably less sensitive) odor detection systems. In extreme cases, like with glucose roach baits, it is possible to accidentally select for insects that are repulsed by their preferred food source. Is this a problem? Maybe not, if the rearing environment continues to be strictly controlled, food inputs are exactly the same, and if mating is not impacted by decreased sensitivity. That can rarely be guaranteed in the long term. Even still, studying domestication related olfactory changes can be useful for building fundamental knowledge. Perhaps we can engineer a line of insects that become ravenous when they smell a particular kind of waste. Or maybe an insect can be engineered to mate only when a particular odor enters its containers, allowing for precise life cycle control. This paper describes domestication related olfactory changes in silkworms, which is useful as both a target for functional genetics trials and for understanding how mass rearing affects commercial insects in general.","1"
"Cadmium (Cd) is a mobile, toxic, and non-biodegradable found in various waste streams that could be found in Black Soldier Fly (BSF) substrate. Heavy metals, especially Cadmium (Cd), can accumulate in black soldier fly larvae because of uptake from a contaminated waste. These metals are added to livestock feed to prevent diseases and promote growth in some countries, which is excreted with animal feces. The contaminated feces are then used as fertilizer for crops. This presents a potential risk to animal and crops, which may be fed black soldier fly products. Discussion of genetic mechanisms behind heavy metal management in BSF is limited to a few papers concerning 3 metallothionein (Mt) genes. For this reason, we must look to other model organisms like Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). This paper represents the most up to date and comprehensive review of metallothionein knowledge as it pertains to flies.","1"
"Not all traits involved in commercial insect production are heritable, which is the ability for a trait to be passed down genetically. While many traits in insects are determined by their genetics, there are also many traits that are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, rearing density, and feeding substrate. When a trait is affected by a combination of these factors, it can be difficult to determine which is most important to focus on. By studying the genetic basis of traits and their heritability, scientists can develop more accurate and effective breeding strategies. The authors of this paper explore the heritability of a few industrially relevant traits: body mass, development time, boldness, and activity level.","1"

It turned out be related to “linkage”, which in this case meant that a low-fitness gene was so close to the high-fitness gene that you couldn’t get one without the other. The paper doesn’t have details about economic impacts, but one can assume that it was significant, given that Round Up Ready 2 (which did not have the yield drag effect) wasn’t available until 13 years later. So, merging genetics with traditional breeding-looking at things like linkage, recombination rates, and selection effects-is crucial to sidestepping issues like yield drag and other unintended effects.","1"

"The use of genetically modified organisms (GMO) is the subject of controversy. Special interest groups lobby against its use on the basis of ethical, health, or environmental risks.

"Genetic engineering serves as a potent instrument for creating novel characteristics or enhancing existing ones. This paper describes genetic engineering in silkworms, which have led to interesting features like glow in the dark or multicolored silk. Genetically modified organisms (GMO) in the food/feed sector could be used to create similar changes. For example, introducing color changes that only apply to one sex, which would allow for automatic sorting (useful when managing mating systems). Other modifications could include altered nutrient profiles (ex: more omega-3 fatty acids), enhanced digestion of specific waste types, faster growth, and greater disease resistance. GMO products come with their own challenges, though, such as ensuring that the altered gene spreads and persists in the original insect population. This paper introduces the concept of parthenocloning (asexual, egg-based reproduction) as one way to improve the efficiency of GMO projects.","1"

"Telomeres are protective caps on DNA, like the plastic ends of shoelaces, that keep the ends of a chromosome from breaking off during cell division. Each time cells divide, they lose a little bit of that protection. Eventually, the telomeres are gone and the cell stops dividing. The problem with creating fast growing insect lines, through breeding or genetic modification, is it leads to more frequent cell division/growth. This has the potential to cause shorter lifespan or an aging phenotype. This is especially true if the parents are older (with shorter telomeres) at the time of fertilization. It is critical that we understand how telomeres are affected by genetic and environmental factors, in order to promote the health of cricket stock and avoid low-fitness tradeoffs during selection. This paper shows that crickets have heritable (passes on to children) protective mechanisms that maintain a certain telomere length, even when disturbed by artificially enhanced growth.","1"
"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small, stable, and heat-resistant proteins with bactericidal properties (kills bacteria). They also have a potent inhibitory effect on fungi, viruses, and tumor cells. AMPs often work by disrupting cell membranes but have also been known to inhibit cell wall formation, inhibit cell respiration, or even induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) by attacking bacterial proteins. An AMP’s durability and effectiveness against microbes is directly determined by its 3D structure, so researchers must study form if they wish to optimize function. Members of the IAB benefit from doing the same, in order to ensure the safety of their product reared in variable, and potentially contaminated waste, streams.","1"

"This paper is relevant to insect growers because it highlights the potential of insect-based diets, specifically black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), as a promising feed additive for poultry. The study showed that the inclusion of BSFL in broiler chicken diets can significantly impact the microbial community in the gut, resulting in improved gut health, immune response, and food safety. These findings suggest that the demand for BSFL and other insect-based protein sources as feed additives for poultry may increase, creating new market opportunities for insect growers. Additionally, the use of nanopore sequencing for microbial community analysis provides a potential tool for insect growers to better understand the impact of their insect-based products on animal health and nutrition, leading to improved product development and marketing.","1"
"The research investigates how endosymbionts (Cardinium and Wolbachia) influence the white-backed planthopper Sogatella furcifera, a significant rice pest. The study uncovers that these endosymbionts, whether present individually or together, decrease the diversity of bacteria and modify the structure of the bacterial community during various developmental stages and in different adult tissues. Additionally, the research highlights the impact of endosymbionts on the insect's fecundity and metabolism, pinpointing specific metabolites that play a role in influencing fecundity. The findings underscore the pivotal role of endosymbionts in shaping the microbiota and metabolic responses in S. furcifera, potentially affecting the overall fitness of the host.","1"
"The silkworm industry is several thousand years old. Much research has already been done to characterize pathogens and parasites that prey on them, such as the BmNPV studied in this paper. As knowledge about insect agriculture pathogens grows, and more opportunistic infectious agents fill the niche created by mass rearing, it may be necessary to directly target the most problematic ones. As opposed to using RNAi, which blocks viral genes after they have already been inserted into the silkworm genome and expressed, the authors of this paper use RNA targeting CRISPR/CAS9 systems to directly attack the virus. They are inserting the whole system and guide into the silkworm genome, so the survival effects will be passed down to future generations. Most importantly, the authors showed that their system promoted survival without interfering with commercially relevant traits.","1"
"Insects are thought to have sparsely methylated genes compared to the mammals explored in this review. Nevertheless, many studies demonstrate that DNA methylation governs both developmental and behavioral changes, such as the differences between a queen and a worker bee being largely attributed to variations in methylation patterns. These changes in epigenetic patterns can be passed down to offspring and can impact fitness. For example, in one study, flies with an artificially induced activity H3K27 activity (promotes methylation) produced two generations of offspring that were less tolerant to high fat diets. At the very least, this paper shows how the conditions in one batch can influence the output of subsequent generations. One optimistic interpretation is that, by determining the targets for genes like H3K27, these influences can be accounted for. Even better, since a small number of adults are needed to produce a large number of larvae, it may be economical to prime the adults first so that their offspring are more tolerant to whatever austere conditions might exist in mass scale (heat, nutrient, pathogenic stress).","1"

"The traditional understanding of evolution describes slow, gradual changes that occur over millions of years. However, evolution is not just something that happened to dinosaurs millions of years ago; it is a dynamic and continual process that profoundly affects all living things today. Nor is it necessarily limited to long geological timescales. As early as the 1800s, researchers demonstrated that adaptation could occur on human scales, revealing that industrial pollution led to moths developing darker coats—a phenomenon known as industrial melanism. Insect evolution is especially rapid, facilitated by short generation times and a large number of offspring. All of these factors show that insects have great potential for adaptation, and therefore optimization, if we can decode and leverage the mechanisms behind these rapid evolutionary shifts.","1"

"Recently, commercial silkworm farmers have been producing transgenic lines. This means that they used techniques like Crispr/Cas9 to inject foreign DNA. The advantage of such a process over traditional breeding methods is that you can get traits that don’t exist anywhere in the population. For example, making silk that glows or using black soldier fly AMPs to increase pathogen resistance. Artificial selection, on the other hand, only works on alleles (versions of a genes) that exist in your specific strain. Genetic modification is a powerful tool to create innovative products, but there are some risks associated with it. This paper explores the potential damage that transgenic silkworms can cause. Given that CEIF explores novel solutions like Crispr/Cas9, it is important that we pay attention to logistical and regulatory barriers to rearing GMO insects.","1"

"Evolution can act on slow timetables. For example, the last common ancestor between humans and chimpanzees (one of our closest relatives) split off anywhere between 6 and 8 million years ago. Research has shown evidence of rapid adaptation, though, sometimes within a few generations. This is especially true with anthropogenic (human) selection like domestication. So how can we improve upon the already well adapted insect agriculture species on a human timeline? We need to understand how rapid adaptation occurs in the first place, so that these biological mechanisms can be exploited. The authors argue that silkworms have shown large changes to physical traits compared to the amount of time they have been domesticated. This paper proposes that modifications to DNA (methylation) played a large role in silkworm domestication. It is possible that small alterations to regulatory genes, either through genetic modification or environmental triggers, could lead to large shifts in the direction of commercially relevant traits.","1"
"Natural evolution is often discussed in terms of thousands or millions of years. Human involvement can speed up this process a little bit. The silkworm, arguably the only truly domesticated insect, has been exposed to human selection for several thousand years. The commercial insect industry operates on a much shorter time scale. Fortunately, evidence shows that especially strong selection can result in rapid adaptation under certain conditions. It is important to understand which traits/genes can benefit from selection and which conditions lead to the fastest evolution of industrially important traits. This paper describes one situation in which less than a decade of strong selection produced a population of crickets that don’t sing (typically important in mating and fighting rivals).","1"
"The study provides important insights into the functional evolution of termite gut microbiota, which is relevant for the development of sustainable and efficient lignocellulose-based biofuel production systems.

"Breeding exploits selection forces to drive change. The nature of change and the impact of input from the breeder depends on many factors. One of them is the competition between positive forces acting on the trait of interest to increase its frequency and negative forces acting in the opposite direction. A given trait may be inherited along with a low-fitness trait by virtue of proximity. Trade-offs or unintentional selection may do the same. In the example described in this paper, the authors show that natural selection competes with sexual selection on cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). More CHCs in crickets improve fitness because they are more resistant to drying. On the other hand, more CHCs interfere with sexual signaling. The specific results of this study are useful for any cricket breeders looking to improve desiccation tolerance, so that they don’t overcommit traits that will face strong opposing forces. In general, the study underscores the importance of a holistic approach to breeding, one that considers the multifaceted interactions between traits, environmental factors, and selection pressures. For example, would increasing or decreasing CHC sensitivity in females result in lower or greater tolerance of an otherwise high-fitness trait? Ensuring that sexual selection is working in the same direction of commercially relevant traits, rather than acting antagonistically, could be a key strategy in achieving successful breeding outcomes in a timely manner.","1"

"The first assembled human genome cost about 3 billion dollars (in the 90s) and 13 years of organized effort. Today, even relatively small companies and labs can support previously cost prohibitive projects like genome assembly. Nor are we limited to whole genome data.

"Transposons, also known as transposable elements (TEs) or mobile DNA, are pieces of DNA that cut or copy themselves and add their sequence to another part of the genome. They play a pivotal role in domestication, breeding, and evolution in general. The authors of this paper study how TEs promote insecticide resistance. Insecticides are known to contaminate water systems and waste products from crops and animals, so it is likely that insect agriculture species will encounter these chemicals. One potential concern is the impact of insecticides on colony health. Another is that products derived from commercial insects will, themselves, be contaminated. This paper describes TE-mediated adaptations that have helped fruit flies survive, which may be transferrable to other mass reared insects.","1"

"The study aimed to understand the role of microbiomes in caterpillars, crucial herbivores and agricultural pests. Analyzing gut microbiomes from 124 wild leaf-eating caterpillar species, researchers found that caterpillars had low-density and variable gut microbes compared to other insects and vertebrates. Microbes from consumed plants appeared in caterpillar feces, suggesting ingested microbes enter the gut but fail to establish as resident symbionts. Antibiotic suppression of gut bacterial activity in model species Manduca sexta did not affect weight gain, development, or survival, indicating that microbes might not significantly impact caterpillar biology. Caterpillars' unique digestive physiology, including high pH, simple gut structure, and rapid digestion, may inhibit microbial colonization. Host-specific digestive and detoxification mechanisms likely render symbionts unnecessary for caterpillar herbivory. This study highlights caterpillars' independence from symbionts, illustrating a potential widespread lifestyle among animals.","1"

"For insect growers, this study holds significant relevance as it sheds light on the intricate interplay between post-mating changes, microbiomes, and reproductive outcomes in Drosophila melanogaster females. The insights gained from this research have the potential to inform and improve insect rearing practices. Understanding the impact of mating and microbiome on behavior, metabolism, egg production, and gene expression can aid growers in optimizing breeding strategies to enhance insect productivity and health. The findings regarding differences in fecundity between females with and without a microbiome highlight the importance of considering microbial communities in insect rearing environments. Moreover, the influence of the male partner's microbiome on both female fecundity and transcriptional profiles emphasizes the significance of managing the microbiome of breeding pairs. By recognizing the crucial role of microbiomes in shaping post-mating changes, insect growers can make informed decisions to promote successful reproduction, resulting in healthier and more productive insect populations for various applications, such as agriculture, biocontrol, and research.","1"
"The cultivation of edible insects presents a viable approach to producing protein-rich food and feed while maintaining a minimal environmental impact.

"When wild species are introduced to a laboratory environment, changes are often observed in genetic diversity, gene expression, and microbiome composition. Not all genetic changes are bad, and some are deliberately selected for, but a reduction in diversity is associated with reduced fitness, an effect called inbreeding depression. In addition to fitness costs, a small and homogeneous population is more vulnerable to genetic drift, which is the tendency of genes to either be fixed or lost in a population. Even if a gene is “good”, it can still be lost from a population through random chance if its frequency is low enough. The same is true for “bad” genes and harmful alleles (versions of a gene) can become fixed in a population. One way of alleviating inbreeding depression is through a process called genetic rescue, which uses outbreeding to add new genes to a population. This paper describes how genetic rescue increased the fitness of an inbred fruit fly population. It shows how we many do the same with other inbred lines in commercial insect production.","1"

"The black soldier fly industry is relatively new, but commercial production of insects has a long history, especially in eastern countries like China. The silkworm (Bombyx mori) is a convenient model organism to study insect domestication and a valuable resource for good practicing in mass rearing. The silkworm has been bred for thousands of years for silk production. In some cases, protein coding genes are directly affected by artificial selection. Many protein-coding genes associated with important industrial traits (growth, fecundity, nutrition profile) are also critical to the survival of the insect, so they may be challenging targets for breeding trials or genetic modification. A single change in one nucleotide (DNA), for example, is responsible for the trait that causes human sickle cell disease. In other cases, the activity level of genes (gene expression) is impacted by artificial selection. This won’t create a new kind of protein, but it may increase the strength of that gene's response, like turning up the volume on a radio. The authors of this paper investigate how domestication affects epigenetic modification enzymes (EMEs), which is one way organisms control gene activity. Understanding EMEs will provide commercial insect breeders with one more tool to fine tune their genetic stock.","1"

"Saprophagous insects, those that feed on decaying organic matter, like mealworms and BSF, are exposed to a wide variety of microbial threats. One way they respond to pathogens is through the release of AMPs. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small, stable, and heat-resistant proteins with a potent inhibitory effect on bacteria, fungi, viruses, and tumor cells. BSF produce at least 50 AMPs, which makes them a valuable resource for drug discovery. In addition, as is shown in this paper, it is possible to express these AMPs in other commercial insect species (or even between BSF strains) to promote survival in mass rearing.","1"

"Some argue that silkworms are the only truly domesticated insect species. Many others would include honeybees or crickets- it depends on a given writer’s interpretation of the word “domesticated”. In any case, most examples of human domestication concern vertebrates like cats and cows. To better understand how insect agriculture species are being affected by human selection, and how that process can be improved, it is sometimes necessary to step outside of Arthropoda. Dogs are a classic example of domestication. They are genetically distant from insect agriculture species, but are exposed to similar conditions. The two groups face problems like inbreeding and population bottlenecks due to controlled mating and sampling of a small number of individuals for breeding. They experience strong selection, both deliberately, as humans favor certain desirable traits, and incidentally as a result of differences in conditions like temperature, light cycles, and pathogen exposure. As evidenced by health problems unique to certain dog breeds, domestication can result in lowered fitness if not managed properly. For this reason, it would behoove modern domesticators to learn from examples past successes and failures.","1"
